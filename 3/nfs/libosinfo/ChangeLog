	ci: refresh containers for CentOS-8 PowerTools repo rename
	A recent CentOS-8 update renamed the "PowerTools" repo to "powertools"
	and since dnf is case sensitive wrt repo names, this broke ability to
	build new containers.

	The refresh fixes the repo name and pulls in other misc improvements
	to containers.

	gitlab: update refresh script for changed host naming convention

	gitlab: refresh containers with lcitool for fully minimized base

	gitlab: re-generate container images from lcitool
	This introduces Fedora 33 and removes some redundant packages.

	Note that rpm build is marked as skip on CentOS 8/Stream now, since
	we're using pip provide meson instead of distro meson, and thus don't
	have the %meson macro.

	tools,detect: improve command line option help
	Literal identifiers, such as 'media', 'tree', etc in translatable
	strings are a bad idea, since they will likely be translated, misguiding
	users reading the help of a translated version.

	Refactor a bit the way these bits are show to the user:
	- in the help of --format and --type, show a generic name of the
	  argument value, and slightly improve the description text
	- add a small description text after the listing of the command line
	  options to mention the allowed values

	ci: Don't use RPM=skip for container builds
	It only makes sense for actual build jobs.

	ci: Check for rpmbuild availability
	Only try to build RPMs if the rpmbuild command is present on the
	system. This means we no longer have to use the RPM=skip trick on
	Debian-based targets, and can limit it to cases where building
	RPMs is actually broken for some reason.

	ci: Simplify rpmbuild command
	We don't have to worry about cleaning up after ourselves, since
	we're running the build inside an ephemeral container.

	ci: Add CentOS Stream
	Starting with

	  commit d35a7dba9cc8ac3bb0647171628731c625d4e14f
	  Author: Erik Skultety <eskultet@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Thu Jun 4 16:17:36 2020 +0200

	    guests: Add CentOS Stream

	    The idea behind Stream is to get a preview of what the next RHEL-minor
	    will look like, thus getting newer versions of packages than regular
	    CentOS provides. It's supposed to be rolling, so currently it's based on
	    CentOS 8, but once RHEL-9 is out, it will point to the next RHEL-9
	    instead.  However, unlike debian-sid it doesn't have a dedicated URL
	    resource (something like centos-stream), so we'll have to change it
	    manually once it's flipped to point to next RHEL-9.

	    Signed-off-by: Erik Skultety <eskultet@redhat.com>

	lcitool supports CentOS Stream as a build target.

	ci: Use $MESON_OPTS
	This information is part of the container image now.

	ci: Refresh Dockerfiles
	Starting with

	  commit 25c9da0aaa94fbca674dca6dec65f6348f335e7d
	  Author: Andrea Bolognani <abologna@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Fri May 22 17:38:10 2020 +0200

	    lcitool: Generate MESON_OPTS in Dockerfiles

	    This serves the same purpose as CONFIGURE_OPTS: enable seamless
	    cross-compilation support, in this case for Meson-based projects.

	    Only MinGW cross-compilation targets are currently supported.

	    Signed-off-by: Andrea Bolognani <abologna@redhat.com>

	lcitool will include a $MESON_OPTS environment variable, which can
	be used to simplify our GitLab CI build rules, in the Dockerfiles
	it generates.

	ci: Move Dockerfiles to a subdir
	This is consistent to how libvirt organizes its files, and ensures
	things will remain tidy even as we introduce new features such as,
	later on, Cirrus CI support.

	ci: Clean up refresh script a bit
	Remove some repetition through refactoring.

	This does not slow down builds, because containers are only rebuilt
	when the corresponding Dockerfile has been modified.

	build-aux: use gmake for syntax-check rules
	Previously on FreeBSD the syntax-check rules would be a no-op because
	its non-GNU make wouldn't see the GNUmakefile and would report no work
	to do:

	$ MESON_SOURCE_ROOT=`pwd` build-aux/syntax-check
	`syntax-check' is up to date.

	Since we moved everything into a syntax-check.mk that we call explicitly
	though, we're the non-GNU make tries to execute rules that depend on
	GNU make features.

	build-aux: fix references to old maint.mk name

2020-05-13  Daniel P. Berrangé  <berrange@redhat.com>

	build-aux: rename maint.mk to syntax-check.mk
	This name aligns with what the makefile actally does.

	build-aux: remove GNUmakefile entirely
	The only useful bits it still did were setting a couple of variables,
	which can be moved into the main maint.mk file.

	build-aux: merge cfg.mk into maint.mk
	Since we took full ownership of a cut down maint.mk there's no
	need to keep local additions separately in cfg.mk

	This fixes a bug which caused the contents of cfg.mk to be
	skipped since the moving of files into the build-aux dir
	and switch to meson.

	build-aux: trim obsolete maint rules
	Many rules in maint.mk are doing checks related to makefiles, or
	autoconf, or gnulib, none of which are used by libosinfo. There
	are also many misc rules related to publishing of releases that
	are never used. Trimming this out makes the resulting file more
	managable.

	ci: Use 'check-dco' container for DCO checking
	This container image, which has been created for this specific
	purporse and is already used by many projects under the libvirt
	umbrella, contains a nicer Python implementation of the
	require-dco.sh script that's guaranteed to be kept up to date.

	ci: Merge templates into native-build-job
	At this point, the only difference between the existing templates
	is that one of them includes the RPM build job, and since we now
	have a way to skip that part for specific targets, we can get rid
	of the duplication and merge them into a single template.

	ci: Introduce multilib
	This is a bit yucky, but it's only temporary: like the target ABI,
	this information is tied to the container image and as such should
	be baked into it. When that happens, we can simply drop this
	altogether, but in the meantime this bit of scripting allow us to
	have a single environment instead of two.

	ci: Merge templates into mingw-build-job
	The mingw32 and mingw64 templates are basically identical at this
	point, so let's merge them into a generic one.

	ci: Split off mingw-environment
	Follow the environment/script split, like we do everywhere else.

	We can have a single environment that works both for mingw32 and
	mingw64 builds because the only difference between the two is
	which ABI they target, and we can obtain that piece of information
	from the $ABI environment variable that's baked into the container
	images.

	ci: Move more information to the job templates
	In particular, we can avoid repeating the parts of the container
	image name that are always the same.

	ci: Introduce pipeline stages
	There's only a single stage for now.

	ci: Use standard template for CentOS 7 and openSUSE 15.1
	The only difference between the open-coded job definition currently
	in use for these target platforms and the standard template is that
	the former don't include the RPM build job, but now that we have a
	way to skip that part selectively we can remove these special cases.

	ci: Make RPM job skippable
	We're sort of cheating by exiting right away when asked to skip
	the RPM job, but we know that it's always going to be the last job
	in a script and we currently have no need to skip any other job,
	so let's start with the simplest possible implementation and
	consider something more complex if and when the need arises.

	prepare-release: Move release archive out of DIST_ROOT
	If the build has been successful, we can fish the release archive
	out of DIST_ROOT and expose it in the top-level source directory,
	just like autotools would do, for extra convenience.

	prepare-release: Define DIST_ROOT
	This is the subdirectory of BUILD_ROOT where the release archive
	is generated by Meson: it's already used multiple times, and we're
	about to introduce another one, so let's give it its own variable.

	prepare-release: Define BUILD_ROOT
	This fits nicely with INSTALL_ROOT and the recently-introduced
	RPMBUILD_ROOT; additionally, since $BUILD_ROOT is an absolute path,
	we can use it directly as _sourcedir when calling rpmbuild.

	prepare-release: Use a local directory for rpmbuild
	The current release process stores files inside the user's rpmbuild
	directory, usually part of $HOME, which is just bad manners. Use a
	local directory instead.

	prepare-release: Use a local directory for installation
	The current release process stores files inside the user's home
	directory, which is just bad manners. Use a local directory instead.

	Since we no longer have to care about the destination directory
	looking like an actual root filesystem, we can make the paths used
	when installing MinGW builds shorter.

	prepare-release: Use DESTDIR when installing
	DESTDIR and --prefix are similar but serve distinct purposes: in
	particular, the latter is intended for modifications that will
	persist after installation, eg. storing binaries under /usr/bin
	instead of /usr/local/bin, while the former is just a temporary
	change that can be easily reverted, eg. stashing files in an
	intermediate, unprivileged directory while building a package.

	Our needs during the release process are closer to what DESTDIR is
	designed for, so let's use that.

2020-04-17  Andrea Bolognani  <abologna@redhat.com>

	prepare-release: Ensure rpmbuild is executable
	Using 'test -x' is more appropriate than 'test -r' for programs.

	prepare-release: Drop RESULTS
	This is a leftover from when the script was used to perform
	automated tests: in that context, singling out the output of the
	test suite made sense, but now we're no longer particularly
	interested in it.

	As a bonus, this allows us to drop a non-trivial chunk of fairly
	obscure POSIX shell compatibility code.

	prepare-release: Remove unnecessary cleanup
	We already remove all of build/ at the beginning of the build
	process, so there's no need to manually remove any of its subdirs
	here.

	prepare-release: Remove empty lines
	These are unnecessary and inconsistent with the style used in the
	rest of the script.

	prepare-release: Use correct spec file for MinGW RPMs
	Currently we're just building the very same spec file twice.

	gitignore: Minimize
	Things like editor backup files belong in the user's own ignore
	file rather than in the project's.

	productfilter: Check productfilter in _clear_product_constraint{,s}
	Let's just add a safety check in the _clear_product_constraint() and
	_clear_product_constraints() functions.

	devicelinkfilter: Check devicelinkfilter in _get_target_filter()
	Let's just add a safety check in the _get_target_filter() function.

	filter: Check filter in _clear_constraint{,s}
	Let's just add a safety check in the _clear_constraint() and

	db: Remove useless osinfo_db_finalize() declaration

	install_config_param: Use g_clear_object in _set_value_map()

	entity: Check entity in osinfo_entity_clear_param()
	Let's just add a safety check in _clear_param().

	Group all GObjectClass override methods

	Use g_object_class_install_properties()
	Using _install_properties() helps to keep the code cleaner and also
	reduces the chance of having wrong props used.

	Use G_DEFINE_*_WITH_PRIVATE
	Together with this change, let's also get rid of our own _GET_PRIVATE()
	macros and use _get_instance_private() method instead.

	Use OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE* macros

	macros: Add OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE* macros
	OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE is nothing else than a define to
	G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE macro from GLib.

	OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE does exactly the same thing as
	OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE plus adds a private structure to the declared type
	structure.

	OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE_AND_CLASS does exactly the same thing
	as OSINFO_DECLARE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE plus declares the class structure of
	the declared type.

	Using those new macros will help us to reduce a lot the GLib boilerplate
	in our codebase.

	Do not error out when inlining fails
	-Winline causes error in GCC10, e.g

	error: inlining failed in call to ‘OSINFO_LIST’: call is unlikely and code size would grow [-Werror=inline]

	That particular macro, which will be introduced in the next commit, is
	bas based on GLib own macros and it just so happens that if they were
	also compiled with -Winline, the same error would happen [1]. Instead,
	let just suppress those warnings.

	Enforce '-Wdeclaration-after-statement'
	Enforcing that variables are only declared in the beginning of a block
	makes the code easier to read.

	image: Add cloud-init property
	cloud-init has been added on 81c43558687b40d but the property has never
	been added.

	datamap: Rename _init() argument name
	"list" was a c&p from when OsinfoDatamap was introduced.

	avatar_format: Remove unused OSINFO_AVATAR_FORMAT_GET_PRIVATE()
	OsinfoAvatarFormat does not have a private member.

	tests: Remove duplicated tests
	There's no reason to keep testing union, filter, and intersection on
	types which inherit from OsinfoList. Mainly considering test-list
	already test those.

	Update Copyright year

	Remove Fabiano Fidêncio's Copyright statements
	Does not make sense to keep my own Copyright statements in 3 files of
	the project, which were added during 2012's Google Summer of Code.

	Remove Authors
	Authors are not often updated and do not reflect the current state of
	the code.

	media/tree: Force "wget" user-agent in SoupSession
	Spoiler alert, it'll sound insane ... because it is insane. Some servers
	treat libsoup user-agent differently than how they treat wget
	user-agent.

	With the default agent set, Soup would end up downloading the file
	containing the redirection information, instead of actually redirecting
	to one of the addresses present in that file. While when forcing "wget"
	as user-agent, the redirection happens as expected.

	This issue was faced at least with CentOS[0] and Manjaro[1] links.

	After a talk with Patrick Griffis, he mentioned that:
	"I imagine there isn't too much of a problem pretending to be wget. I would
	guess the assumption by these services is 'A CLI tool is downloading us and
	not a browser' rather than 'wget has unique behavior'.".

	Knowing that, let's force "wget" as user-agent on our side.

	Add API to track distro cloud-init usernames
	We already have cloud-init='true' so add a cloud-image-username='foo' to
	go with it.

	The property has been added to `OsinfoOs` instead of `OsinfoImage`
	because it's not expected to change in a per image basis. Instead we can

	tests: Add tests for only matching "rolling" as a fallback
	The reason to have this in a different commit from the code is to ease
	the backport of the previous patch by the distros which feel like doing
	that.

	db: Match "rolling" distros only as a fallback
	Let's only match "rolling" distros as a fallback. The reason we need to
	do so is to properly deal with distros as Manjaro, which has a mix of
	versioned and rolling entries.

	By matching the "rolling" only as a fallback, we ensure we'll have
	exhausted all the "versioned" possibilites in the first place.

	tests: Remove invalid release-status test
	This should be tested on osinfo-db side and leaving this test here
	causes failures in other non-related tests, all of them related to
	identify_media, which gets the release-status and ends up hitting the
	failures caused by this specific test.

	media: Fix typo in the "eject-after-install" description
	"installtion" should be "installation", as pointed out by Oğuz Ersen.
	Together with the change, libosinfo.pot has been regenerated.

	gitlab: Enable ccache usage
	The $PATH definition has always included a reference to the symlink
	farm that is used to enable transparent ccache usage, but since the
	directory itself does not exist in the container image it never did
	anything.

	Since libvirt-jenkins-ci commit 2563aebb6c5c, container images do
	actually contain the symlink directory, so it's finally possible to
	enable ccache usage. This requires including the correct directory
	in $PATH, as well as telling 1) ccache where to store its data and
	2) GitLab that this data should be preserved across jobs.

	The exact cache size (50 MB) is sort of arbitrary, but it should
	be enough to store build artifacts for both osinfo-db-tools and
	libosinfo for the foreseeable future.

	gitlab: Create job templates
	These avoid having to repeat the same build steps over and over.

	gitlab: Use $MAKE
	Just like $NINJA, this is defined as part of the container's
	environment.

	gitlab: Don't define $NINJA
	Since libvirt-jenkins-ci commit 27cfddee8835, paths to build tools
	such as ninja and make are exported in the container's environment
	and can be used directly.

	Move the "Since" after the description, so the description block
	(including the version) is properly handled.

	gitignore: remove almost all old content
	Some of the content refers to autotools, which is not used anymore.
	Also, meson enforces builddir!=srcdir, so the generated build files are
	never directly among the sources.

	Hence remove almost all the existing content, as it is not relevant.

2020-02-24  Andrea Bolognani  <abologna@redhat.com>

	ci: Perform MinGW builds in dedicated containers
	Instead of using the same Fedora 30 container for both native and
	MinGW builds, we are now building separate containers tailored for
	each scenario. Re-introduce MinGW builds, and have them use the
	new container images.

	The corresponding libvirt-dockerfiles commit is ea6286acbbfd.

	ci: Temporarily disable MinGW builds
	We're going to use dedicated container images for them going
	forward, but switching all at once would break CI so let's do it
	in two steps: first disable the current builds, then enable the
	new ones once the external requirements (container images) are
	in place for a smoother transition.

	loader: Avoid conflicting object ids for extension files
	Currently, when building the id of some of our objects, we do:
	- Loop over the several objects of that type;
	  - Concatenate the id of the parent object with the loop index;

	By doing this, conflicts can be seen when using more than one extension
	file, as osinfo-db does for Windows, where pre and post installable
	drivers extension files are used and end up being loaded as we'd do:

	- Loop over pre installable drivers;
	  - Concatenate the id of the parent object with the loop index;

	- Loop over post installable drivers;
	  - Concatenate the id of the parent object with the loop index;

	In order to avoid such issues, let's also use the filename as part of
	the object id, avoiding then conflicts.

	It's important to note that the conflict is cause by osinfo_list_add(),
	which will replace the object in the list in case some other object with
	the very same id is already stored there.

	Silence -Wstring-plus-int
	The warning is triggered because we're ignoring the "treeinfo-" part of
	the OSINFO_TREE_PROP_TREEINFO_* string.

	A possible way to fix that, instead of just disabling the warning, would
	be doing something like:
	```
	const char *prop = OSINFO_TREE_PROP_TREEINFO_FAMILY;
	prop += strlen("treeinfo-");
	```

	However, I sincerely do not think it's worth the verbosity of the

	Post release version bump to 1.8.0

	Update NEWS for 1.7.1 release

	build: Switch the project's version to 1.7.1
	It's done as an 1.7.1 release is needed in order to fix the breakage
	caused by not using versioned symbols in 1.7.0 release.

	build: Only define {PCI,USB}_IDS in {pci,usb}-ids-path are defined
	Setting those regardless of {pci,usb}-ids-path being explicitly set or
	automatically detected is a regression compared to what we were doing
	when using autotools.

	build: Set {pci,usb}.ids paths
	In case pci.ids or usb.ids files are shipped by libosinfo, pci_ids_path

	When building a project using Meson, the project will be installed
	respecting the multi-library path.

	In order to get the right path we should do:

	  - Use the value of `dpkg-architecture -q DEB_TARGET_MULTIARCH`
	- RPM based machines:
	  - Use the value of `rpm --eval '%{_lib}'`

	meson: Add syntax-check as part of our test-suite
	Let's take advantage of that we can run `make syntax-check` without the

	Move files needed for `make syntax-check` to build-aux
	Together with the changes, let's adapt GNUmakefile and maint.mk in order
	to be able to run those files from build-aux.

	GNUmakefile:
	- changing both srcdir & top_srcdir, and adjusting the includes of
	  cfg.mk and maint.mk were enough to be able to run `make syntax-check`
	  from build-aux directory;

	maint.mk:
	- "ME" variable had to be changed to point to the right place;
	- Some paths expecting cfg.mk in the top_srcdir had to be changed;
	- tight-scope.mk target dependency has been changed from $(ME) to
	  maint.mk;

	Support `make syntax-check` without Makefile
	A few dirty hacks have been done in GNUmakefile, cfg.mk, and maint.mk
	in order to support running `make syntax-check` without having to have a
	Makefile around.

	GNUmakefile: set srcdir & top_srcdir and remove the parts that would
	cause an error due to no presence of a Makefile.

	cfg.mk: add sc_prohibit_always-defined_macros to the list of local
	checks to skip as it looks for Makefile, which is generated after
	running ./configure.

	maint.mk: allow running `make syntax-check` without having a Makefile
	generated.

	Drop autotools support
	Let's try to drop autotools support as meson is in place. There are a
	few files that were not dropped though, as:
	- cfg.mk
	- maint.mk
	- GNUmakefile
	- build-aux/bracket-spacing.pl
	- build-aux/gitlog-to-changelog
	- build-aux/useless-if-before-free
	- build-aux/vc-list-files

	From the list above, build-aux/gitlog-to-changelog is currently used by
	meson as part of the `dist`.

	All the other files, with a few changes, will be useful for meson as,
	with a few changes, we will be able have `ninja syntax-check` working.

	spec: Adapt to use meson
	The changes needed in the spec files are not so intrusive.

	One thing that has to be mentioned is the requirement for
	mingw-filesystem >= 107 (which is only present on Fedora 30+) in order
	to generate the mingw rpms for osinfo-db-tools. This huge bump in the
	version happened because the `%mingw_ninja_install` was only recently

	build: Use a minimum gettext requirement rather than an exact one
	In configure.ac, specify the minimum gettext version we require, rather
	than the exact one. This fixes a situation where the autoconf macros
	used for gettext will be the latest available on the system (for
	example, 0.20); but the copied-in Makefile.in.in will be for the exact
	version specified in configure.ac (in this case, 0.19).

	In that situation, the gettext build rules will error out at `make` time
	with the message:
	   *** error: gettext infrastructure mismatch: using a Makefile.in.in
	   from gettext version 0.19 but the autoconf macros are from gettext
	   version 0.20

	Avoid that by specifying a minimum version dependency rather than an
	exact one. This should not cause problems as we haven’t committed any
	generated or external gettext files into git, so each developer will end
	up regenerating the build system for their system’s version of gettext,
	as expected.

	See the subsection of
	https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Version-Control-Issues.html
	for more information.

	This patch is basically the same as

	media: Add _is_bootable() API
	Let's add an API in order to let the applications known whether a media

	media: Only error out if a media is not bootable when REQUIRE_BOOTABLE flag is passed
	It'll give more flexibility for the apps to, at least, detect a media,
	even if the media is not bootable.

	media: Add OsinfoMediaDetectFlags
	Let's add a new type in order to specify flags to osinfo_media_detect.
	This type, at least for now, contains only one specific flag that will
	be used to specify whether the detection of the media should or should
	not fail in case the media is not bootable.

	media: Ignore case when detecting bootable ppc ISO
	When detecting a PPC bootable iso, we should search by the
	"/ppc/bootinfo.txt" file inside the iso. However, there's no guarantee
	that the name of the file will be always lowercased as it depends on the
	extensions used to generate the ISO.

	The problematic ISO can be found at:
	http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/9.9.0/ppc64el/iso-cd/debian-9.9.0-ppc64el-netinst.iso

	And one curious thing to mention is that there's no TRANS.TBL file (the
	one used to translate, for instance, PPC -> ppc) present in the ISO.

	tree: Cleanup _create_from_location_async_helper()
	There's no need to pass neither the URL nor the cancellable to this

	tree: Avoid use of memory after it's freed
	We've been passing data->location as the @url argument of
	osinfo_tree_create_from_location_async_helper(), freeing it and trying
	to g_strdup() it as the new content of data->location.

	In order to avoid doing so, let's set the data->location only once, in
	the first caller of osinfo_tree_create_from_location_async_helper(), as
	its content is always going to be the same doesn't matter the treeinfo

	As any consumer of libosinfo API may pass NULL as the @matched argument

	tests: Add tests for multiple short-ids
	I've decided to for testing the multiple short-ids at the os level, as
	it reflects better the usage of the newly added APIs.

	https://gitlab.com/libosinfo/libosinfo/issues/19

	Reviewed-by: Cole Robinson <crobinso@redhat.com>

	product: Add osinfo_product_get_short_id_list() API
	As multiple short-ids is fully supported, let's add a new API for
	getting the whole list instead.

	https://gitlab.com/libosinfo/libosinfo/issues/19

	Reviewed-by: Cole Robinson <crobinso@redhat.com>

	loader: Fully support multiple short-id values
	osinfo-db schema allows for multiple short-id, and there's already some
	entries that rely on that. For example, debian and ubuntu have something
	like:
	```
	<short-id>debian9</short-id>
	<short-id>debianstretch</short-id>
	```

	or

	```
	<short-id>ubuntu19.04</short-id>
	<short-id>ubuntudisco</short-id>
	```

	However, OsinfoLoader has always been treating "short-id" as a single
	property entry and, as a consequence of this, apps would always have to
	use the first listed id as shown below:
	```
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ osinfo-install-script debian9
	preseed.cfg
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ osinfo-install-script debianstretch
	Error finding OS: debianstretch
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ osinfo-install-script ubuntu19.04
	preseed.cfg
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ osinfo-install-script ubuntudisco
	Error finding OS: ubuntudisco
	```

	As OsinfoEntity already has support for multiple property entries, let's
	take advantage of this and properly treat OSINFO_PRODUCT_PROP_SHORT_ID as
	so.

	This doesn't break any compatibility with the existent code as
	osinfo_entity_get_param_value() will *always* return the first added
	entry, as it was done before.

	OsinfoFilter also already has support for multiple property entries and
	the filter works as expected.

	Here's the result of the very same example used above with this fix:
	```
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ ./tools/osinfo-install-script debian9
	preseed.cfg
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ ./tools/osinfo-install-script debianstretch
	preseed.cfg
	fidencio@dahmer ~/src/upstream/libosinfo $ ./tools/osinfo-install-script ubuntu19.04

	size.

	One example is the ubuntu-18.04.1.0-live-server-amd64.iso media, which
	has as volume-id 'Ubuntu-Server 18.04.1+ LTS amd64'. As the volume-id
	has exactly 32 characters it's never been matched as when reading the

	up receiving malfunctioning responses from NetBSD CDN.

	Dan investigated the issue found out that the problem is that libcurl in
	CentOS 7 at least is not ignoring the body. Sometimes it closes the
	keepalive connection so this doesn't matter, but other times it gives
	us back the body that it should be ignoring.

	In order to work the issue around, let's no re-use the curl handler but
	always open a new one for each of the URIs.

	tests: add one test case per OS tested
	The image, media & tree URIs test suites just register one test case for
	all the work they do. As a result when they run they just sit there
	printing no progress information for a long time.

	This changes then to register one test case per OS in the database. As a
	result we get progress information. An added benefit is that it is
	possible to now run tests for individual OS by passing the -p argument.

	media: Pass the source object to GTask new
	When creating the new GTask in osinfo_media_create_from_location_async,
	no source object has been passed. Consequently
	search_ppc_bootinfo_callback receives NULL as its source object, causing
	warnings when trying to unref it.

	Let's just pass the stream as the source object of the GTask in
	osinfo_media_create_from_location_async in order to avoid the issue.

	The issue has been introduced as part of 29f97cb7648.

	media: Don't try to unref a NULL entry
	In case g_file_read_finish() fails, the stream will always be NULL.
	The issue has been introduced as part of f977527c82.

	media: Check whether PPC ISOs are bootable
	PPC ISOs do not have the "El Torito" extension that describes whether
	the media is bootable or not. However, they have a "bootinfo.txt" file
	placed under "ppc" directory in order to specify the media is bootable.

	So, let's add a few more checks looking for "/ppc/bootinfo.txt" in case
	the El Torito header is not found.

	The whole implementation has been based on the following sources:
	- The ISO 9660 (ECMA-119) specification:
	  http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-119.pdf
	- The ISO 9660 osdev wiki page:
	  https://wiki.osdev.org/ISO_9660
	- IBM's developer article:
	  https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-detecting-bootable-ibm-power-server-iso-images/index.html

	And what the implementation does is:
	- Access the *root* directory record, which has a fixed size of 33 bytes
	  and is located at the bytes offset 156 of the PVD;
	- Load the *root* directory record extent content into the memory and:
	  - Search for the the dir/file we're looking at;
	  - In the dir is present, we load its directory record extent content
	    into the memory and search for the next dir/file;
	    - In case the file is present, we return that the media is bootable;
	    - Otherwise, we return the media is non bootable;

	Mind, though, that this code is *not* generic enough to be adapted in
	case we want to search for a different dir/file and the reason for that
	is related to some ISOs using a TRANS.TBL table that translates the
	given name of a file to the shown name of the same file.

	If, for some reason, we ever want to take the path of having this code
	more generic we'd have to:
	- For each directory acessed, search for TRANS.TBL;
	  - In case it's present, load its content into a hash table and, for
	    each dir/file, check the name of the file we're looking for with the
	    shown name (only present in the TRANS.TBL;
	  - Otherwise, just follow the very same code we currently have;

	The decision for not implementing this TRANS.TBL changes is, mainly,
	because it'd make the code circa twice slower than it currently is
	(as we'd have to search for the TRANS.TBL as the first thing ...)
	without any specific gain for the needs we have right now. In case
	there's the need, in the future, it could be implemented in the way
	described here.

	Those new methods are going to be used to tell the install-scripts

	so as the command-line may be different depending on the
	injection-method used, for example:
	- fedora using cdrom, disk or floppy: ks=hd:/(vda|sda)/fedora.ks
	- fedora using initrd: ks=file:/fedora.ks

	It's important to mention that although the methods are taking GFlags,
	those are treated as GEnum and only one value is expected to be set, as
	mentioned in the documentation.

	Also, mind that the usage of osinfo_entity_set_param() to store the
	nick of the OSINFO_INSTALL_SCRIPT_INJECTION_METHOD_* is intentional as
	the nick is exactly what's going to be used in the install-scripts to
	generate the proper command-line.

	os: Support inherited resources
	As resources are pretty much the same for new releases of a same OS,
	having them explicitly set is a source of copy-and-paste error and
	redundant information in our db.

	The approach taken to properly support inheritance of OSes is a
	explicitly set attribute to the resources indicating that they should be
	inherited.

	Here's an example of how the XML will look like:
	foo:
	  <resources arch="all">
	    <minimum>
	      <n_cpus>1</n_cpus>
	      <storage>1</storage>
	    </minimum>
	  </resources>

	bar (which derives-from/clones foo):
	  <resources arch="all" inherit="true">
	    <minimum>
	      <n_cpus>3</n_cpus>
	      <ram>3</ram>
	    </minimum>
	  </resources>

	When querying for bar's minimum resources, we'll get:
	n_cpus: 3
	cpu: -1 (not set, by any of the OSes)
	ram: 3
	storage: 1

	loader: Set "inherit" accordingly to the resources
	"inherit" is the new attribute of the resources that means whether this
	resources should have its (non filled) values inherited.

	In case the "inherit" attribute is present and as is "true", let's set
	it. Otherwise (the default option), there's no change from the current
	behaviour.

	os: Deal with "removed" devices
	This commit introduces some logic to deal with "removed" devices and the
	way chosen to do so was to filter out the "removed" devices from the
	full list of devices (for both DeviceLinks and Device lists).

	_get_devices_internal(). With that in mind, let's avoid code
	duplication and have a single function that can be used in both methods.

	loader: Introduce OSINFO_ERROR
	Since glib commit 2.31.10~16 [1], g_set_error() will issue a warning if
	it's passed a NULL domain. libosinfo is doing this in a few places (try
	for example 'osinfo-query os winxp'). This commit adds a generic OSINFO_ERROR
	domain which will be used instead of NULL. It's a bit inconsistent with
	OSINFO_MEDIA_ERROR and OSINFO_TREE_ERROR in that they both start with
	"osinfo-*" while OSINFO_ERROR uses "libosinfo". However, since
	OsinfoLoader already makes use of that quark, changing that would
	arguably be an (very small) ABI break.

	autogen: Don't hardcode --enable-gtk-doc
	The usual behavior is for configure to detect the availability
	of gtk-doc, along with other optional features, and only enable
	it if found.

	Hardcoding it this way is causing issues for MinGW builds,
	where pkg-config is looking in the MinGW-specific paths and
	can't locate the native gtk-doc.pc file, thus concluding
	gtk-doc must not be present and aborting the build altogether
	instead of simply skipping API reference generation.

	Both 'make distcheck' (through the DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
	variable) and the prepare-release.sh script are already
	enforcing the availability of gtk-doc when preparing releases,
	so it's safe to use the default behavior for regular builds.

	loader: process files in alphabetical order
	Currently when loading DB files we process them in whatever order
	readdir() returns them in, which is often inode order. This makes the
	order of loading files non-deterministic across installs, and if there
	are ambiguities in the data, we can in turn get different results.
	eg ISO images match different OS entries depending on load order.

	Alphabetically sorting the files doesn't remove any ambiguity that
	may exist, but at least gives us consistent results on every host.

	Switch from libsoup to libcurl
	libsoup is used to check the validity of URLs in distributions in

	To overcome this limitation, switch to libcurl: while it requires
	slightly more code to do the same task, it provides a bit more
	flexibility, and support for other protocols.  No version check is
	performed, since the APIs used are old enough.

	Add 'eject-after-install' parameter to OsinfoMedia
	If the media is an installer, thus specifies whether the media should be
	ejected after the installation process. Default value is true.

	This is mainly needed for applications like GNOME Boxes (and maybe
	virt-install) to be able to decide whether the media should be ejected
	or not when the final reboot happens during its installation process.

	The latter case may happen when the installer leaves some packages to be
	installed after rebooting the OS for the last time.

	The issue solved by this patch is a corner-case faced when adding the
	install scripts for SLES, as during its installation only one reboot is
	performed (so, installer-reboots attribute doesn't help us) and the media
	must not be ejected after the reboot in order to finish the installation.

		1001  Virtio block device
		1002  Virtio memory balloon
		1003  Virtio console
		1004  Virtio SCSI
		1005  Virtio RNG
		1009  Virtio filesystem
		1041  Virtio network device
		1042  Virtio block device
		1043  Virtio console
		1044  Virtio RNG
		1045  Virtio memory balloon
		1048  Virtio SCSI
		1049  Virtio filesystem
		1050  Virtio GPU
		1052  Virtio input

	Of which, only 1001, 1001, 1002 and 1009 were recorded in
	libosinfo. They would have appeared via pci.ids file loading,
	but they would have lacked friendly names.

	test: Remove empty line at end of XML test file
	This fixes a make syntax-check failure.

	install-script: Return glib-allocated string from ::apply_xslt()
	Strings created by libxml2 should be freed with xmlFree while glib ones
	should be freed with g_free, so it's cleaner to allocate the string
	returned from ::apply_xslt() with the glib allocator as it's meant to be
	g_free'ed later on.

	osinfo: Add GDestroyNotify callback to g_task_return_pointer calls
	The GDestroyNotify callback passed to g_task_return_pointer() is used to
	free the associated pointer in case g_task_propagate_pointer() is not
	called (error cases, _finish() never called, ...).

	When the GTask owns the pointer it's passed through
	g_task_return_pointer() (for example the _finish() function is (transfer
	full) and only calls g_task_propagate_pointer()), we need to set a
	GDestroyNotify when calling g_task_return_pointer() or we may have leaks
	in corner cases.

	tools: Fix OsinfoOs leak in osinfo-install-script
	The OsinfoOs instance returned by osinfo_media_get_os() must be unref'ed
	when no longer needed.
	osinfo-install-script has code doing:
	if (media == NULL) {
	        os = find_os();
	} else {
	        os = osinfo_media_get_os();
	}

	find_os() does not return a ref'ed OsinfoOs to the caller, while
	osinfo_media_get_os() does. In order to make it possible to release the
	ref returned by osinfo_media_get_os(), this commit changes find_os() to
	always ref the OsinfoOs instance it returns.

	Moreover, one of the codepaths in find_os() looks like it was
	potentially returning an invalid pointer:

	os = OSINFO_OS(osinfo_list_get_nth(OSINFO_LIST(filteredList), 0));
	g_object_unref(filteredList);

	The OsinfoOs instance was probably kept alive by references held outside
	of the filtered list, but it's safer to keep a reference to ourselves,
	which this commit is doing anyway in order to fix find_os() memory
	handling.

	install-script: Fix OsinfoOs leaks
	The OsinfoOs instance returned by osinfo_media_get_os must be unref'ed
	when no longer needed.

	This fixes:

	test: Make warnings fatal
	Since standard output is hidden by default while we run make check, it's
	very easy to miss test cases emitting new warnings. This commit uses
	g_log_set_fatal_mask() to ensure that the test cases will abort if a
	warning is emitted while they run. This matches the behaviour of the
	GTest  framework.

	Revert "debian: Allow empty passwords"
	The workaround that has been used so far doesn't work.

	For the user account, the password is indeed removed in the end of the
	installation, but then login in from GDM is impossible. Although it
	works from a VT (depending on the installed version), this is not
	something obvious that every user would try. So, requiring the user
	password seems the best to do for now and when a proper solution is
	found, the user password can be set to optional again.

	For the root account, the password is not removed in the of the
	installation and ends up being set as "dummyPa55w0rd", something that
	the user would never guess, unless they have access to the libosinfo
	code. So, requiring the admin password seems the best to do for now and
	when a proper solution is found the admin password can be set to
	optional again.

	This reverts commit 087a8f8a23895e2d792b0f6d26a9d0c01a6c7e87.

	win8,installer: Tune based on variants
	As Windows 8.1, Windows 8 (most likely) has to have the ProductKey
	skipped during the WindowsPE phase of the script for the enterprise,
	enterprise-debug and professional variants.

	"Most likely" is said because I haven't been able to test the Windows 8
	Professional variant as it needs a VLK and MSDN tells me that only
	administrators can access keys in the Volume Licensing Service Center
	(VLSC).

	Also, I haven't been able to start an installation using none of the
	debug ISOs, as the system reboots just a minute (or so) after booting
	up. It seems to be a problem with the ISOs themselves, as I've

	installer: Use l10n-language as UI language
	Since commit 57b459e09 we set 'EN-US' as UI language instead of 'EN-GB'.
	However, this hack is only necessary for Windows 7 and can cause issues
	when installing newer versions of the Windows, as the installer,
	somehow, gets confused by having different values set to UI language,
	System Locale and User Locale and ends up prompting a window for letting
	the user to set these values.

	By limiting the hack to Windows 7, this patch fixes the installation of
	'EN-GB' ISOs of Windows 8 and 8.1 (the ones tested for now).

	win8.1,installer: Force Windows activation
	I've noticed that when installing Windows 8.1 the activation is not done
	by the end of the unattended installation and, actually, the serial
	number shown in the Activate Windows program is different than the one
	used to perform the installation. Also, when tring to activate the
	software it fails with the "Windows can't be activate. Try again later"
	message and no useful details about the error.

	So, in order to avoid this issue, let's force the activation in the
	FirstLogon phase of the installation script by directly editing the
	Slmgr.vbs options for Volume Activation.

	For more info about the Slmgr.vbs Options for Volume Activation, please,

	win8.1,installer: Tune based on variants
	So, I ended up doing tests with all ISOs that I have access from MSDN
	and here is the conclusion:

	Windows 8.1
	 Problematic:
	  en_windows_8_1_enterprise_debug_checked_x64_dvd_2756358.iso

	  en_windows_8_1_enterprise_x64_dvd_2971902.iso
	  en_windows_8_1_pro_n_vl_x64_dvd_2971969.iso

	 Non-problematic:
	  en_windows_8_1_n_debug_checked_x64_dvd_2707894.iso
	  en_windows_8_1_debug_checked_x64_dvd_2707208.iso
	  en_windows_8_1_n_x64_dvd_2707896.iso

	Windows 8.1 with Updates:
	 Problematic:
	  en_windows_8.1_enterprise_n_with_update_x64_dvd_6050225.iso
	  en_windows_8.1_enterprise_with_update_x64_dvd_6054382.iso
	  en_windows_8.1_pro_n_vl_with_update_x64_dvd_6050969.iso
	  en_windows_8.1_pro_vl_with_update_x64_dvd_6050880.iso

	 Non-problematic:
	  en_windows_8.1_n_with_update_x64_dvd_6051677.iso
	  en_windows_8.1_with_update_x64_dvd_6051480.iso

	Based on this info, the best way to go is:
	- Set the ProductKey during the WindowsPE phase of the setup only in the
	  following conditions:
	  - any Windows media that is not Windows 8.1 (as it was before)
	  - Windows 8.1 media has no variant
	  - Windows 8.1 media contains on its variant debug but doesn't contain
	    enterprise on it

	  These rules will cover medias with no variant and with "debug" variant
	  that are not enterprise. All the rest (Enterprise, Enterprise Debug
	  and Professional) will have the ProductKey skipped during the
	  WindowsPE phase of the setup.

	don't include autogenerated enum files in dist
	Previous commit 77cf2730eb6e5503a9bd40e6baf7cc0b393a9dc7
	reverts 4e488678d4af0e54da7400851d554bc4c4497c76 (fixes
	to the VPATH build) because it was said to break the
	make distcheck.

	After examining the problem, it seems this commit was not
	in fact the problem - it merely exposed the existing bug
	elsewhere.

	The real problem is that we were including the autogenerated
	enum files in the dist. So when doing builds from git those
	files were in $builddir, but when doing builds from dist
	those files were in $srcdir. Except that 'make distclean'
	would delete the enum files, which would again cause them
	to appear in $builddir.

	So the real fix is stop including the enum files in the dist

	build: fix VPATH based builds
	The VPATH build fails because the enum generator is told to
	look for two generated files in the $srcdir instead of builddir.
	We should not in fact loom the generated files at all when building
	enums, so they can be removed.

	The g-ir-scanner is also missing a -I$(build_dir) to let it find
	the generated files.

	Finally the gtk-doc tools were not being told to look in the
	$(build_dir)

	autobuild.sh: enable gtk doc build when testing

	autobuild.sh: fix flag to turn on werror

	tests: Add testcases for ID collision in OsinfoList
	This will detect issues fixed by the commit fixing osinfo_list_add.

	list: Fix replacement in osinfo_list_add
	OsinfoList maintains a mapping between a const char *entity_id and an
	OsinfoEntity object. It does so by using both a GPtrArray and a
	GHashTable.

	When an entity is added to an OsinfoList, a pointer from the
	OsinfoEntity is used as the key (through osinfo_entity_get_id()) and
	the OsinfoEntity is g_object_ref'ed and used as a value.
	The OsinfoEntity is also appended to the array mentioned previously.
	The use of g_hash_table_new_full() ensures that the OsinfoEntity will be
	unref'ed when it's removed from the hash table.

	However, when trying to add an entity with the same id as one already
	present in the OsinfoList, several issues occur:
	- g_hash_table_insert() is used, which means the preexisting entity with
	  the same id is going to get removed, and thus g_object_unref'ed.
	  However, the _old_ key will still be used by the hash table, which
	  means that if the OsinfoList was holding the last reference to the
	  old OsinfoEntity, the key stored in the hash table is going to
	  point to freed memory
	- similarly, we make no attempt at removing the preexisting entity from
	  the GPtrArray, so this will also contain stale data

	This commit makes sure we remove entities with the same id from the
	GPtrArray when this situation occurs. It uses g_hash_table_replace()
	rather than g_hash_table_insert() which replaces both the key and the
	value if the hash table already contains the same key.

	This fixes some valgrind issues or crashes that occurred when running
	make check in a libosinfo tree with 2 databases, one in the old layout
	and one using the new layout.

	l10n: Update translations from zanata

2015-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	loader: re-add support for loading files explicitly
	Some existing applications pass an XML file to the
	osinfo_loader_process_path method, so we must continue
	to support this, even though we want apps to switch to
	using a directory of XML files, one per entity.

	This requires us to re-add the 'skipMissing' flag for
	use when loading files.

	The other change is that we need to disable the code
	that checks relative paths when loading a single file,
	instead of files inside a directory.

	loader: remove leading / from relative path
	Fix the warning

	** (gnome-boxes:5499): WARNING **: Entity http://opensuse.org/opensuse/11.4 should be in file /os/opensuse.org/opensuse-11.4.xml not os/opensuse.org/opensuse-11.4.xml

	by removing the leading '/', since g_file_get_relative_path
	does not use a leading '/'

2015-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	loader: don't return NULL from a void method

	loader: implement new semantics for entity overriding
	This implements the new scheme for allowing entities to
	be overridden. If an XML file relative path matches one
	in an earlier datbase directory, the original file is
	not loaded at all. Any files in a ENTITY-NAME.d will
	now augment earlier data rather than replace it.

	eg consider these files

	1. /usr/share/libosinfo/db/os/fedoraproject.org/fedora-22.xml
	2. /etc/libosinfo/db/os/fedoraproject.org/fedora-22.xml
	3. $HOME/.config/libosinfo/db/os/fedoraproject.org/fedora-22.d/extra.xml

	File #1 will not get loaded, because file #2 is detected
	as a full override. File #2 will get loaded to define the
	main Fedora 22 OS, and then file #3 will get loaded to
	augment the main data.

	Most of the PCI and USB device info in the local DB is
	just augmenting the pci.ids and usb.ids master files,
	so these need to move to .d directories now

	loader: skip leading whitespace in USB/PCI ids strings
	When parsing the usb.ids & pci.ids files, we must skip any
	leading whitespace in the vendor/device/subsystem strings.

	loader: sanity check entity filenames when loading
	When we have loaded the id attribute of the entity, check it
	against the entity filename to ensure its XML document was
	held in a file with the modern naming.

	This merely prints out a warning for now to avoid breaking
	existing users, but in the future, files with non-compliant
	names will not be loaded at all.

	loader: rework handling of pci.ids and usb.ids
	Currently we have the option to download pci.ids/usb.ids or
	symlink to the distro provided version given to configure.

	Change configure so that it searches for the files in a
	variety of expected locations. This ensures we always use
	the external files, in any modern Linux distro, without
	the user needing to give an arg. We look for them in

	   /usr/share/hwdata/{pci.ids,usb.ids} (RHEL/Fedora)
	   /usr/share/misc/{pci.ids,usb.ids}   (Ubuntu/Debian/Gentoo)
	   /usr/share/{pci.ids,usb.ids}        (SLES/OpenSuse)

	Instead of loading the pci.ids/usb.ids files as part of
	the main database file enumeration process, explicitly
	load them from their expected location. This avoids the
	need to symlink the distro provided files into the database
	dir.

	loader: rewrite loader to separate file enumeration from loading
	The current loader code enumerates files, processing them as it
	finds them. This changes it into a two stage process, first
	enumerating all files and then loading all files. This will
	facilitate later patches which will change the way files are
	enumerated.

	loader: re-arrange code for loading list of directories
	Re-arrange the loading code so that there is a single helper
	method that takes an array of GFile * to load. This will
	facilitate future code for handling overrides between
	directories.

	loader: pull out code for building database paths
	Create standalone helper methods for constructing a GFile
	object for the system/local/user database paths.

	data: remove "virtio" and "ide" as buses
	The virtio devices don't use a virtio bus, rather than virtio
	protocol is layered over another bus like pci.

	IDE is not a bus type we need to track compatibility for.

	tests: switch to use XML from builddir only
	All XML files are given a .in suffix, even if they don't contain
	translations, so we can assume all .xml files are now in the
	build dir, and nothing in the source dir needs loading.

	Update ignore files for new database layout

	data: remove pluralization from data directories
	eg instead of platforms/qemu.org/qemu-1.2.0.xml we just have
	platform/qemu.org/qemu-1.2.0. The top level directory name
	now matches the entity name exactly

	"hypevisors". Change the dir name to "platforms" to be consistent.

	data: standard install script URI format
	Fix the URI format for install scripts to take the scheme

	where "$script" is the type of install script (ie kickstart,

	URI to refer to is ibm.com not qemu.org

	data: fix URI scheme use for ib700 device
	The ib700 device currently uses a URI of "isa://ib700". Change the
	URI to refer to the product vendor (http://ibasetechnologies.net)
	and use a path of "isa/ib700" for the device.

	data: change URIs for netware OS
	The common URI path format is distro/version, so make netware
	URIs comply.

	data: fix typos in altlinux, debian and rhl datasets
	The versions for altlinux 5/6/7 are inconsistent, sometimes
	using 1 digit, sometimes 2 digits and sometimes 3 digits.
	Change them all to use 2 digits as was practice for earlier
	versions. Also remove codenames from the product name.

	Debian buzz was 1.1, not 1.0 - there was never an
	official 1.0 release.

	The version of RHL 6.2 was wrong

	data: change GNOME URIs to include 'gnome' prefix
	Change GNOME URIs to include 'gnome' as the first part of
	the URI path, since this will be used to identify filenames
	later.

	data: change QEMU/KVM ID URIs to include product string
	Include "qemu" and "qemu-kvm" as the first part of the path
	component of the URIs, since this will be used to form a
	filename later.

	data: fix RHEL Xen platform versions & adjust IDs
	Currently the RHEL Xen platform is returning the same version
	number for multiple entities. Fix this by suffixing the Xen
	version with the RHEL version. Change the short-id and URI
	IDs so they are of the form 'xen-rhel-$VERSION' eg

	  http://redhat.com/xen-rhel/3.1.0.5.6
	  xen-rhel-3.1.0.5.6

	data: sanitize Xen device ID URIs and add missing devs
	The Xen devices have a formal device ID value, which is used
	in Xen bus. We should record that in the <product-id> field
	and add a corresponding <product> string. Change the device
	ID URIs so that they are of the format

	  http://xen.org/xen/$PRODUCT-ID

	Finally add various devices that were missing.

	data: remove duplication in Xen hypervisor devices
	Every Xen hypervisor platform has duplicated the list of
	supported devices. The RHEL Xen platforms also missed out
	the <upgrades> relationships. Remove all the device
	duplication and rely on inheritance instead.

	data: change PCI and USB device ID URIs
	Currently PCI and USB device URIs look like

	  http://pciids.sourceforge.net/v2.2/pci.ids/8086/2668
	  http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids/80ee/0021

	We want to associate filenames with URIs in a well-defined format.
	These existing URIs, particular the PCI one, are too long in the
	path component.

	It is also desirable to use the industry standards body as the
	domain name, rather than the domain of the specific project
	we happen to import data from right now.

	Thus the URIs are changed to

	  http://pcisig.com/pci/1af4/1000
	  http://usb.org/usb/80ee/0021

	data: remove most information about PCI devices
	We already load PCI/USB information from the pci.ids/usb.ids
	files, so should not duplicate it again in XML files. The
	only info we need to retain are the device classes.

	docs: add document describing database organization
	Add a document that sets out the desired end goal for the
	database organization that the following patches will move
	towards.

	docs: describe entity URI ID scheme
	Add a doc describing the best practice guidelines around
	the format of URIs for various entities.

	test-isodetect: Don't set size when block size is unknown
	When parsing an isoinfo file, we don't try to set the volume size if the
	'vol_size' was not set. This commit does the same when 'blk_size' is not
	set as volume size is set to vol_size * blk_size.

	test-isodetect: Ignore empty isoinfo fields
	While parsing isoinfo files, test-isodata is going to add empty
	strings ("") to the libosinfo database for the fields it can parse. This
	commit ignores them instead.

	test-isodetect: Fix invalid read when parsing isoinfo files
	While parsing the isoinfo files, we check if the current line starts
	with some prefix, but then we skip one byte more when we pass the string
	to osinfo_entity_set_param(). This accounts for a space which comes
	right after the prefix.
	It can happen that the line being parsed ends right after the prefix
	with no additional space, in which case we'd be accessing invalid memory
	when we try to skip the space.
	This commit adds the additional space to the prefix check, and uses
	strlen() rather than a hardcoded len when skipping the prefix later on.

	This fixes

	data: add missing Xen 3.1.0 release
	The RHEL Xen platforms reference a Xen 3.1.0 release which
	was missing entirely.

	The 3.1.0 was not officially released as a tar.gz but several
	enterprise distros shipped it based off the GIT tag.

	Similarly 3.1.1 & 3.1.2 were not officially released. These

	    Add desktop profile for Windows

	Changed the URI for the existing install scripts to
	have a 'desktop' or 'jeos' suffix. It added both new
	install scripts to existing OS entries, but forgot
	to update the Windows vista entry, so it was left
	pointing to a non-existant script.

	loader: identify referenced but not defined entities
	When loading the database we often have to instantiate
	entities to represent relationships (upgrades, derives,
	etc) before the entity is actually defined. This makes
	the code liable to bugs as we might instantiate entities
	which are never defined.

	This extends the loader so that it tracks all entities
	that are created via references, and once loading is
	complete it prints out a warning if any referenced
	entities were not defined fully.

	This identifies a number of mistakes in our current
	database that the following patches will fix.

	loader: fix memory leaks when loading data
	The 'lang' attribute needs to be free'd with xmlFree.

	The install script config param needs to be unref'd
	since when it is added to the install script an extra
	ref is taken.

	The install script avatar needs to be unref'd since
	when it is added to the install script an extra ref is
	taken.

	build: fix path to locale files in mingw RPM
	The mingw RPM spec listed the locale files in the libdir
	instead of datadir

	test: load XML files from builddir too
	If the builddir is separate from the sourcedir we must load
	files from the former too, otherwise we miss all the XML
	files which are translated.

	build: fix ChangeLog generation in VPATH build
	When running 'make dist' from a VPATH, the ChangeLog file
	is not generated because it doesn't find the .git directory

	build: fix VPATH based builds
	The VPATH build fails because the enum generator is told to
	look for two generated files in the $srcdir instead of builddir.
	We should not in fact loom the generated files at all when building
	enums, so they can be removed.

	The g-ir-scanner is also missing a -I$(build_dir) to let it find
	the generated files.

	Finally the gtk-doc tools were not being told to look in the
	$(build_dir)

	rhel: Add RHELSA 7.1 volume ID

	rhel: Narrow down RHELSA 7.0 volume ID regexp
	It's currently matching RHELSA.*aarch64 regardless of the version number
	present in the volume ID. This means it will likely match all RHELSA 7.x
	releases in addition to RHELSA 7.0

	win10: Add one volume ID
	Data was provided by Vaclav Ehrlich

	win8.1: Add 2 more volume IDs
	The regex matching x86-64 enterprise variants is not as strict as it
	could: it's going to match IR5_CENNA_X64FREV or IR1_CENA_X64FREV for
	example for which we don't have test cases.
	However, I'm confident this will match
	en_windows_8.1_enterprise_n_with_update_x64_dvd.iso and
	en_windows_8.1_enterprise_x64_dvd.iso
	if such ISOs exist, and that it's not going to give us false
	positives. Since it might allow us to identify unknown ISOs
	without false positives, I went for it.

	Ditch udev rule
	New udev/blkid expose more ISO9660 properties that apps can grab and
	set on install media for detection to work. As a result our udev rule
	becomes redundant.

	This improves system bootup time conciderably if there is an ISO9660
	media inserted during bootup as our udev rule needed to parse the XML
	etc and is therefore pretty slow (keeping in mind that a few seconds are
	a long time in the land of modern udev/systemd).

	fedora: Enable installer scripts for F21
	Now that these scripts work for at least one of the variants (which was
	always the case for all Fedora versions we supported the installer
	scripts for anyway), let's enable them.

	fedora,script: Fix netinst auto-install
	The fedora install script was written for and tested against installer
	DVDs so it does not work for netiso. This patch fixes the issue by
	removing the install method commands and adding remote repos if the
	media is detected to be a netiso.

	fedora: Separate variant for F21 netiso

	tools,install-script: Allow arg to be a media file
	Now that we have API to generate scripts for specific media and since
	it is the recommended path to generating scripts, let's allow users of
	this tool to provide an installer or live media as argument.

	tests: Pass media to script generator
	Now that we have an API to pass media to script generation methods, let's
	test that API instead since its not only the recommended API but also this
	way we get to test both passing of OS and media information to script
	template.

	One of the test cases still uses the existing API on purpose to keep the
	case of 'no media available' covered as well.

	Recommend osinfo_install_script_generate_*for_media()
	Recommend the use of the new script generation API that takes an
	identified media object as argument rather than OS, in the docs.

	Add osinfo_install_script_generate_command_line_for_media()
	Add variant of osinfo_install_script_generate_command_line() that takes
	(an identified) media instead of an OS. Currently no commandline
	template needs access to media but lets add this to be future safe and
	be consistent with other osinfo_install_script_generation*() API.

	Add osinfo_install_script_generate_output_for_media*()
	Add variant of osinfo_install_script_generate_for_media*() that
	generates the script into a file.

	Add osinfo_install_script_generate_for_media*()
	Add API that allows apps to pass the media matched against the OS they
	are generating the script for. Scripts can use this information to make
	decisions about how installation should be setup. For example, we are
	going to use this in the Fedora installer script to decide whether to
	install from ISO or from network, based on whether or not media is a
	network installer.

	fedora: Add F21 server netiso media entries

	fedora: Add volume size info for F21 ISOs

	tests,fedora: Add testcases for all F20 ISOs

	fedora: Separate media entry for each ISO
	Different ISOs have different volume sizes so to be able to add volume
	size info to all medias, we have to create separate media entry for each
	ISO. Moreover, apart from the fact that this makes one particular XML
	file a lot bigger than we'd like it to be, this change makes a lot of
	sense anyway.

	This will also make addition of sequence numbers to multi-disc
	installer medias, much easier later.

	test: Replace F19 & F21 Alpha ISO data w/ released
	Both F19 and F21 has been released. Not only its better to keep test
	data against released ISOs rather than Alpha ISOs, the volume-size is
	obviously different between released and Alpha ISO so if we want to add
	volume-size for these ISOs to our database, we need this change to avoid
	breaking the tests.

	db: Use volume-size info for detection
	If volume-size is known of a media, ensure that it's the same as media
	being compared with, for detection. This will enable us to differentiate
	ISOs with exactly same volume-id, system-id and application-id.

	It's possible that we encounter two different ISOs that have the same
	volume-size, not just the other IDs but chances of that happening are
	extremely small. Even if that happens, this patch doesn't make things
	worse for that scenario.

	test-isodetect: Load volume size info
	Our data on various ISOs provide volume size information. Lets load
	that information so that its part of our tests.

	fedora,script: Don't specify interface
	Its not guaranteed that we'll have 'eth0' available or that it will be

	device for us.

	fedora: Add/update media & tree info for F21
	Fedora now has variants and simply updating the ISO URLs is not a good
	way forward. This patch adds information about media/tree of each
	variant seperately.

	Unfortunately, there is no installer media for Workstation variant and
	even though Server netiso is actually generic enough to let user install
	Workstation as well, both netiso and full installer ISO have the exact
	same volume-id so we can't simply assign netiso a (fake) generic variant
	and be done with it. :( For more details:

	osinfo/Makefile.am currently attempts to generate these files in

	debian: Add needs-internet flag to JEOS script

	question seems not to be meant to be preseeded and I don't know a way
	to do it.

	debian: Allow empty passwords
	This uses the same workaround as the Fedora express installation script.
	If an empty password is given, the password is set to a dummy password
	to prevent the installer from erroring out and deleted later.

	debian: Better resources for wheezy
	We currently specify recommended RAM for wheezy to be 512MiB and storage
	to be 5.4GB. Given that the user might not only want to install a bare
	system but also do something with the system 20GB of disk space and 1GiB
	of RAM are a reasonable amount. Furthermore the debian desktop express
	installation script will fail with less than about 15GB or so.

	build: add libraries via _LIBADD, not _LDFLAGS
	Make sure we use the _LIBADD variable for adding our dependencies.

	Adding libraries via _LDFLAGS means that we have our libraries appearing
	before the user's LDFLAGS environment variable, which is bad, because
	the LDFLAGS from pkg-config could contain -L for system paths and
	jhbuild sets LDFLAGS to -L${prefix}/lib so that we can find the
	libraries in the user's jhbuild install path.  If the system path flags
	come before the user's directory then we'll get the wrong version.

	Also: automake documentation says it's wrong and would actually error
	out on this if it wasn't hidden behind a variable substitution.

	Stop using <foo>true</foo> in libosinfo database
	libosinfo can now parse <foo/> as an alternative to <foo>true</foo> to
	represent a boolean. As the former is the preferred representation, switch
	to using this in the data libosinfo ships.

	Teach osinfo_loader_entity() how to parse booleans
	We want to support both <foo>true</foo> and <foo/> to specify booleans. Now
	that osinfo_loader_entity additional keys have type information, we can
	use a dedicated boolean parser for boolean keys.

	Add type info to osinfo_loader_entity() 'key' argument
	When using 'string(./foo)' as an XPath query, if foo does not exist, an
	empty string ("") will be returned. Thus osinfo_loader_string() ignores
	empty strings during parsing. This happens during regular parsing as we try
	to lookup string(./foo[lang(XX-xx)]) for localized nodes,  and ignore its
	result if the XPath query returns ""

	However, we want to represent booleans as <foo/>. Boolean values are
	currently parsed using osinfo_loader_string(). Parsing <foo/> as a string
	would return an empty string. This means such nodes would be ignored as the
	current parser is not able to make the difference between an existing node
	with empty content and a non-existing node.

	By associating type information to the additional keys we want
	osinfo_loader_entity() to parse, we'll be able to indicate which values are
	booleans, and to parse them accordingly.

2013-11-06  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Allow to pass a NULL 'keys' argument to osinfo_loader_entity()
	Some callers don't want to pass in any additional keys, and would have to
	resort to build a dummy empty key list to pass to osinfo_loader_entity().
	It's better to allow for that 'keys' argument to be NULL and have
	osinfo_loader_entity() deal with it.

	gnome: Add info about gnome-continuous 3.10 images
	Unlike the previous os entries for 'gnome', that were targetted towards
	Fedora-based live ISOs, this one is targetted for qcow2 (and hopefully in
	future ISOs) images produced by gnome-continuous:

	https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeContinuous
	http://build.gnome.org/ostree/buildmaster/images/z/current/

	Would be really nice for libosinfo to be able to detect OS from images
	too but that might not be feasible so at least for now apps would have
	to do their own detection (perhaps through guestfs). Once OS matched to
	a libosinfo's OS definition, apps can at least use libosinfo to figure
	minimum/recommended resources, which devices are supported and a nice
	default name etc to be able to create a decent/working VM given an
	installed disk image.

	The resources set were based on Colin Walters advice:

	<zeenix> walters: hi. Would you be able to approximate min. system
	requirements for 3.10 images?
	<zeenix> walters: i was thinking of just copying the ones from fedora 19
	(at least for now)
	<walters> zeenix: offhand i'd say dual core and 1G of memory
	<drago01> is llvmpipe really happy with just two cores?

	Move osinfo_install_script_add_config_param to private header
	When this method was added, we forgot to add it to the .sym file.
	It's meant to work with the osinfo_install_script_*_config_param()
	API, but these methods are not really consistent with the rest of
	libosinfo API, they belong in an OsinfoInstallConfigParamList class
	which was added in 789adb2a.

	Disable static libraries by default
	Every source file is currently built twice by libtool, once for
	the shared library and once for the static library. Static libs
	are not commonly packaged by distros and slow down compilation

	Time for non-parallel make

	      shared only: 22 secs
	  shared + static: 40 secs

	Those few people who really want them, can pass --enable-static
	to configure

	Disabling them by default requires use of LT_INIT. We don't need

	installer: API to query device driver signing requirement
	Some OS vendors recommend or require device drivers to be signed by them
	before these device drivers could be installed on their OS. This
	recommendation/requirement then also applies to the installer scripts of
	that particular OS.

	This API enables apps to query such requirement/recommendation, if any.

	install-config,winxp,win7: API to enable/disable driver signing
	While I thought that I had solved the problem of Windows requiring
	signed device drivers and QXL driver being unsigned, I could't be more
	wrong:

	* The registry key magic I used for disabling driver signature checks
	  on XP seems to be far from reliable. I tested it many many times but
	  on a weird broken version of XP home edition that I can't seem to
	  have access to anymore. I now tested against both home and professional
	  editions both with and without this registry key magic and I observed
	  the same result in both cases: Drivers do get installed but they remain
	  unused by the OS after installation. The only reliable way of
	  effectively disabling signture checks during installation is through
	  the 'DriverSigningPolicy' option in .sif file, which means disabling
	  signature checks permanently.
	* On Windows 7, disabling integrity checks and test signing after
	  drivers' installation disables the already installed drivers too if
	  they are not signed.
	* The reason I thought QXL was functional at first was that automatic
	  resolution setting was working. Turns out that unlike on Linux, on
	  windows automatic resolution setting only requires spice-vdagent where
	  as QXL is only required for arbitrary resolutions.

	So to make QXL working out of the box, I'm afraid we don't have any
	choice but to disable driver signature checks permanently. Since
	signature checks is a security measure from vendors, we need to leave
	it to applications to decide whether they want to do this or not.

	API to query signed status of device drivers
	Some OS vendors recommend or require device drivers to be signed by them
	before these device drivers could be installed on their OS. An API to
	query signed status of the device driver will be useful for apps to be
	able to make a decision whether they want to use the driver or not.

	Later patches add API for querying signature requirements from a script
	and to possibly disable these checks.

	Don't ignore vendor/device name in pci/usb id parser
	These values were parsed but ignored using ignore_value(), leading
	to very incomplete device information when using pci.ids/usb.ids.
	As generally this data comes from <device> nodes in
	libosinfo database, which  takes precedence over
	the pci.ids/usb.ids data, this bug is not visible without removing
	the additional <device> data from the osinfo database.

	Most distros already ship copies of pci.ids/usb.ids. This commit

	win8: Use complete IDs of installer scripts
	This fix combined with previous 2 patches enable apps to create
	unattended installation for Windows 8.

	win7,installer: Adapt for Windows 8
	Win8 seems to require Microsoft-Windows-Setup/UserData/ProductKey/Key to
	be set, which seems to be exclusive with using
	Microsoft-Windows-Setup/ImageInstall/OSImage/InstallFrom/MetaData (or at
	least some care needs to be taken when using both together). As letting
	the Windows installer decide on which OSImage to use from the product key
	rather than hardcoding use of the first OSImage on the ISO seems more
	robust, we switch from InstallFrom installation image selection to
	ProductKey installation image selection.

	Co-author: Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	installer,win7: Require product key
	It turns out that windows installer media can have multiple products and
	product key is one of the ways for windows to choose which product to
	install. In case of Windows 8, unattended installation breaks if a
	product is not choosen as part of autounattend.xml file.

	Since we already require product key for windows XP and we'll use this
	same script for  Windows 8 too, its not too bad to start requiring this
	for Windows 7 as well.

	Also, the product key will be used to automatically activate the Windows
	copy during unattended installation rather than requiring the user to do
	it him/herself at most 30 days after installation.

	Moreover, the following patch that removes /IMAGE/INDEX, will break
	unattended install without a product key in place.

	box installation of virtio, and QXL drivers and vdagent for apps making
	use of our post-installation drivers API (currently only Boxes).

	installer,win7: Adapt windows-cmd.xml for Windows 7
	On Windows 7, we need to make use of integrated bcdedit.exe to enable
	test signing and disable integrity checks before we could attempt to
	install (possibly) unsigned drivers. We use the same app to disable test
	signing and enable integrity checks after installing drivers.

	Since bcdedit.exe does not exist in Window XP, we don't use it on that
	OS. Moreover, since the registry key manipulation on Windows 7 does not
	help anything, we better not fiddle with those on Windows 7 as doing so
	is always discouraged.

	Also since the certutil.exe thats used by driver's .cmd file to add
	driver publisher to trusted list does not exist on Windows XP, we have to
	continue resorting to registry fiddling to enable installation of drivers
	from untrusted publishers for Windows XP.

	While we are talking about win7, you'll note that the checks are for
	vista (6.0 rather than 6.1). This is because the same changes will also
	be most probably needed for vista:

	win7,winxp: Add new driver files of virtio/QXL drivers
	These are publisher certificates that the driver's .cmd file use to
	silence Windows 7 installer warning about untrusted publisher. Obviously
	such a warning dialog that requires user interaction breaks unattended
	installation for apps.

	Although these are (at least currently) redundant for Windows XP, we
	better list them for completion/consistency.

	installer,windows: Use '/c' option of cmd.exe
	Use '/c' option of cmd.exe instead of '/k' as that apparently keeps the
	process running (at least on windows7) and any commands after the loop
	never gets executed.

	TBH I'm a bit confused about '/c' vs '/k' option and the docs don't
	help: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490880.aspx#EBAA

	What I know for certain is that without this change, Windows 7 installer
	just hangs with an empty cmd.exe window open forever at the end of
	installation. Also I have tested that this change doesn't break this
	script for Windows XP.

	The libosinfo database is using a arbitrary unchecked mix of

	2. We don't set the keyboard layout properly yet and just hardcode it to

	test: Add test for param remapping in install scripts

	Use OS-specific config in OsinfoInstallScript
	When generating the unattended installation script, we can now
	use osinfo_install_config_get_param_list() to get OS-specific
	values when available. This will only work when an
	OsinfoInstallConfigParamList is associated with the
	OsinfoInstallConfig being processed.

	Set OsinfoInstallConfig:config-params in osinfo_install_script_apply_template
	This allows translation of generic config to OS-specific config if
	the install script XML specified some datamaps to transform these
	parameters.

	Add osinfo_install_config_new_for_script
	In order to be able to automatically transform configuration parameters set
	on OsinfoInstallConfig instances (ie translate from generic value to
	OS-specific value), we need to have access to the
	OsinfoInstallConfigParamList for the current OsinfoInstallScript as
	this is where the OsinfoDatamaps needed to do the remapping are stored.

	After the previous commits we can now associate an
	OsinfoInstallConfigParamList with an OsinfoInstallConfig instance,
	and we can get the OsinfoInstallConfigParamList corresponding to
	an OsinfoInstallScript instance, so this commit just adds a new
	osinfo_install_config_new_for_script which will create a new
	OsinfoInstallConfig instance associated with the
	OsinfoInstallConfigParamList for a given installation script.

	OsinfoInstallConfig: Use config-params if set
	Now that OsinfoInstallConfig has a 'config-params' property
	which describes the config parameters when it's set, we can
	use it when it's available. OsinfoInstallConfigParams can indeed
	contain a datamap to be used to translate generic libosinfo values
	to OS-specific values.
	This commit introduces an osinfo_install_config_get_param_value_list
	method that will be used in subsequent commits to get these
	OS-specific values when generating install scripts.

2012-12-20  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Add OsinfoInstallConfig:config-params property
	This property lists the parameters that can be set for a given
	OsinfoInstallConfig. This is not enforced, it's only there for
	informative purpose. This will also be used in later commits
	in order to automatically apply transformations on values
	for parameters which have an associated OsinfoDatamap.

	OsinfoInstallScript: Use an OsinfoInstallConfigParamList
	Currently the install script config parameters are stored in a
	raw GList. However, OsinfoInstallScript ends up reimplementing
	part of the OsinfoList API, and the raw GList also does not make
	it convenient to pass the list of config parameters around.
	Replace the internal GList with an OsinfoInstallConfigParamList,
	which has the side-effect of nicely simplifying the code.

	Set id in osinfo_install_config_param_new
	OsinfoInstallConfigParam is an OsinfoEntity, but its _new method
	does not set an id when creating it. This is needed if we want
	to be able to use an OsinfoInstallConfigParamList. The "name"
	argument that is passed at creation time is expected to be unique,
	so we can use that as the entity id even though a full URI would have
	been nicer.

	Add OsinfoInstallConfigParamList

	loader: Parse OsinfoInstallConfigParam::value-map from XML

	Add OsinfoInstallConfigParam::value-map
	If set, this OsinfoDatamap value will be used to map generic
	values to OS-specific values.

	Improve the (short) description of the OsinfoInstallConfigParam and
	OsinfoInstallScript classes.

	test-isodetect: Add test for osinfo_media_get_languages
	By dropping a .lng file similar to:
	[general]
	l10n-language=fr_FR;en_EN;

	it's possible to specify which languages a given media is supposed
	to support. test-isodetect will then check that the languages for this
	media in the OsinfoDb match the expected ones.

	win: Add language information to Windows medias
	Now that libosinfo knows how to use the l10n-language OsinfoDB attribute,
	we can add this data to the various Windows <media> definitions in
	the database.

	Set language in osinfo_db_identify_media
	When an OsinfoMedia for OsinfoDb has a l10n-language property set,
	we are now able to turn it into a proper language list set on the
	media being identified.

	loader: Read media language information
	Getting language information can either be supplied through a
	series of <l10n-language> tag set on the <media> element or through
	a regex that will be applied on the media volume ID.
	The former should be all that is needed for most Linux distros while
	the latter will be useful to get the language of Windows images.

	media: Add OsinfoMedia::languages property
	This lists all the languages a given media can show its UI in.

	Deprecate osinfo_db_guess_os_from_media

	Add osinfo_db_identify_media

	Set OsinfoOs::media for OSes stored in an OsinfoDb

	Add OsinfoMedia::os property

	Add datamaps to rng for validation

	loader: Load datamaps
	Install scripts can add a 'datamap' attribute when they declare
	their config parameters. The value of this attribute is the ID
	of a datamap, which is an XML file containing key/value pairs:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<libosinfo version="0.0.1">
	  <datamap id="http://example.com/osinfo/test">
	    <entry inval="generic-val1" outval="foo"/>
	    <entry> inval="generic-val2" outval="bar"/>
	  </datamap>
	</libosinfo>

	This commit adds support for loading these datamaps. The next patches
	will then make use of these datamaps when the libosinfo user set
	a value for the corresponding config parameter.

	Add datamap classes
	These will be used to remap generic values set by libosinfo users
	to OS-specific values used by OS solution files for automatic
	installation.
	Based on a patch from Daniel P. Berrange.

	loader: Don't harcode '+ 9' in tree loading
	When loading <tree> elements, we want to skip the 'treeinfo-' part
	of entity property names. This is currently done by using a '+ 9',
	using sizeof("treeinfo-") instead will make things more obvious.

	Use G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS everywhere
	Remove the last uses of G_PARAM_STATIC_NAME | G_PARAM_STATIC_NICK |
	G_PARAM_STATIC_BLURB

	Fix GObject property gtk-doc name
	They must be described as ClassName:property-name: or gtk-doc
	won't pick them up. There were some files where '::' was used instead
	of ':' as the class name/property name separator.

	build-sys: Build data/ before test/
	Some test cases use the in-tree database data. Since some database files
	are transformed from .xml.in to .xml during build, it's better to
	build data/ first to ensure they are there when tests try to use
	this data.

	For F17 and older, we hardcode the layout to 'us'. Those require layout
	to be a console layout so we'll need some complicated XSL magic to
	translate from X to console layout if we want to properly support those.

	syms: Alphabetically order osinfo_install_config_*
	This is ordered on the name of the property that is read/set

	list: Include osinfo_filter.h in osinfo_list.h
	osinfo_list.h uses OsinfoFilter so it must include osinfo_filter.h
	to be self-contained.

	Remove obsolete methods from OsinfoDeviceDriverList
	These methods were never part of a libosinfo release, so we can
	remove them without breaking ABI.

	Deprecate osinfo_*list_new_*
	The generic equivalent provided by OsinfoList should be used instead.

	Use new osinfo_list_new_* helpers everywhere
	We need to do that before deprecating all the derived class
	implementations of osinfo_xxxlist_new_*.

	Add osinfo_list_new_*
	Currently, every class inheriting from OsinfoList reimplements
	_new_copy, _new_filtered, _new_intersection and _new_union. This
	commit adds generic implementations of these methodes in OsinfoList
	which will allow us to deprecate all the other implementations.

	osinfo_install_config.c: Describe function arguments
	This patch adds small description to each undocumented
	argument for each function within osinfo_install_config.c.

	Document OsinfoInstallConfigParamPolicy enum

	Document even more arguments
	These files were still missing function arguments description:
	 * osinfo/osinfo_install_script.c
	 * osinfo/osinfo_os.c

	Suppress gtk-doc warnings on missing field description
	Each public visible struct and enum must have documented
	items. If it hasn't, gtk-doc produces a lot of warnings.
	However, things it's complaining about doesn't have any
	interesting attributes, so mark them as private.

2012-12-07  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix internal function names in OsinfoInstallScript
	A few static methods were prefixed with osinfo_os_ instead of

	Add missing osinfo_install_script_get_config_param_list annotation

	Add Fabiano's copyright to some source files
	Fabiano made significant work in the installer code, this commit
	adds his copyright to the files where he is listed in the 'Authors'

	Fix osinfo_loader_root comment
	Some newly added tags were missing from the description

	syms: Remove duplicated symbol
	libosinfo.syms contains the osinfo_install_config_param_new symbol
	twice. Reorder the LIBOSINFO_0.2.0 section to make this obvious,
	and remove the duplicated symbol.

	This is a follow-up to my previous series fixing leaks as a similar
	one was just introduced.

	loader: Fix memory leaks in error paths

	loader: Don't leak 'arch'

	loader: Set GError on osinfo_loader_nodeset failures
	Most of the code in OsinfoLoader check if osinfo_loader_nodeset
	set a GError to see if it failed and never test if it returned -1.
	Better to make sure that we actually set the GError when this
	function fails.

	loader: Use xmlFree to free libxml2 strings
	As libxml2 and glib memory allocation functions can be overridden
	with custom functions, it's important to use the right free functions
	for allocated memory.

	build-sys: Fix circular make dependency
	osinfo_enum_types.h was depending on libosinfo_1_0_include_HEADERS,
	which contains osinfo_enum_types.h. This caused a build-time warning
	from make about a circular dependency.

	Add RHEL 5.5 media information

	Add RHEL data to test suite

	Remove extra blank spaces from .sym file

	win: Small indentation fix

	media: Use G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS

	media: Don't mark properties as _CONSTRUCT
	Marking them as _CONSTRUCT will cause the property setter to be
	called at object construction time to set the property default
	value. For the properties of OsinfoMedia, this causes the default
	value to be stored in the entity store as the property setters
	call osinfo_entity_set_param.

	However, as the getters are careful to use
	osinfo_entity_get_param_*_with_default, this is not useful,
	and wastes memory. This can even be harmful if the default gobject
	property value and the default value passed to
	osinfo_entity_get_param are different, the gobject default will be
	returned, which can be unexpected.

	Fix 'inirtd' typo

	Fix gint64 format string in osinfo_entity_set_param_int64
	osinfo_entity_set_param_int64 printed gint64 values using
	G_GUINT64_FORMAT which is unwanted when the value is
	negative. This bug caused breakage after the changes in
	84969ff9 and 4e86e2bf when trying to read the install-reboot value.

	Until these commits, we stored the textual representation
	of (guint64)-1 (GUINT_MAX) in the entity store, and when trying to convert
	it, g_ascii_strtod was returning -GINT64_MAX, and
	osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64_with_default was returning the
	default value as this value is negative.

	After these commits, g_ascii_strtoll returns GINT64_MAX-1 when trying
	to parse the overlong string stored in the database, and the default
	value is not returned as the data was found in the database.

	Just using the right format (G_GINT64_FORMAT) to convert a gint64 to a
	string fixes this bug.

2012-11-23  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	entity: Fix osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64_with_default
	The way it's currently implemented,
	osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64_with_default will return the
	default value if the value which is being parsed is negative.
	This happens because it tries to reuse osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64
	to do the parsing, which returns -1 when the value could not be found.
	However, we have no way of knowing if the -1 means that the value could
	not be found, or if this means the value was found and its value is -1.
	This is made worse by the fact that we return the default value as
	soon as osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64 returns a negative value,
	not just -1.

	By implementing osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64 by calling
	osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64_with_default rather than doing the
	contrary, we can avoid this issue.

	entity: Use g_ascii_strtoll to parse int64 strings
	osinfo_entity_get_param_value_int64 uses g_ascii_strod to parse
	strings to int64, better to use g_ascii_strtoll which is there
	for that purpose.

	More use of G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS

2012-11-19  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Correct RNG for install-script tree
	* Expect 'install-script' node at toplevel in XML
	* Interleave all child nodes of 'install-script' node
	* Remove duplicate entries for 'id' nodes
	* 'config' node has 'param' nodes under it and they have the attributes
	* Remove redundant nodes that probably got there due to c&p mistake
	* 'product-key-format' and 'config' nodes are optional

	Also validate install scripts

	Make 'filename' more consistent w/ other restrictions
	'filename' should be toplevel node under 'install-script' rather than
	an attribute of its toplevel 'template' child. The reason this was
	previously put in the incorrect place was that the first idea was to have
	multiple files under one install script but we later decided to go for 1
	file per install script.

	Also note that I'm naming the element to 'expected-filename'. This is
	to make it consistent with associated API and to simplify loading code.

	Separate root & user passwd setup in fedora installer
	Separate out root and user password setup in fedora installer so that
	root account is not made passwordless just because user password was
	not specified.

	Specify product key format for windows installers

	Remove redundant install script defines

	Correct a C&P mistake in prop registration

	Minor indentation corrections

	Rename a function to better reflect its task
	osinfo_loader_install_config_param ->
	osinfo_loader_install_config_params.

	Correct InstallConfigParam:policy prop to enum type
	Although this means ABI "breakage", we must keep in mind:

	a. The property getter (the API used by apps) was treating the string
	   value as enum, i-e it was broken for apps so if any app is using this
	   API, they were totally screwed anyways.

	b. Its doubtful that this new API is used by any application out there.

	InstallConfigParam:policy should not be writable
	This actually not only breaks ABI but also the API: we remove one argument
	of _new() function. The prop getter is the main part of this API that an
	app will be using if its using this API at all so I think its worth it to
	correct this now  (while we are causing other breakage here: See next
	patch in this series).

	I am also not certain that _new() should be part of the public API.

	InstallConfigParam props should map to entity params
	Without entity params usage, there is no real benefit of deriving from
	Entity class so this was very much intended from start.

	Add enum param getter/setter helpers
	Add:

	* osinfo_entity_get_param_value_enum
	* osinfo_entity_set_param_enum

	Minor syntax correction to windows-unattend.xml

	Use glib-mkenums to register enums with glib
	This commit adds the generation of osinfo_enum_types.[ch] using
	glib-mkenums. These files will register the various enums that will get
	added to osinfo header files with glib.

	Fix udev rule
	The udev rules for detecting OS'es are too complicated and they also don't
	work when detecting OS'es on e.g. a loop device. For example, the stuff
	about DISK_MEDIA_CHANGE is kinda wrong.

	The latter is pretty annoying as the default action in F18 for an .ISO file
	is to loopback mount it - as a result the user is presented with "Open with
	Files" instead of "Open with Boxes".

	Fixes rhbz#863468

	docs: Remove redundant .types file
	Since we pass --rebuild-types to gtkdoc scanner, .types file is
	generated for us and therefore we don't want to keep this in VCS.

	Add 'installer-reboots' attr. to RNG
	Last patches broke `make check`, this one fixes it.

	Correct 'installer-reboots' value for XP & win7
	The default value of '1' is not correct for these OSs at least.

	Add 'installer-reboots' parameter to OsinfoMedia
	If media is an installer, this specifies the number of reboots the
	installer takes before installation is complete. Default value is '1'.

	This is mainly needed for applications like GNOME Boxes and virt-install
	to be able to tell when OS installation from a given media is complete so
	that they can take whatever post installation steps they may need to.

	osinfo-detect: ignore DB loading errors
	osinfo-detect is currently exiting with a failure when a DB loading

	(http://bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=214681)

	Was discussed in the ML about don't create this files and put all
	information in only one script, separating each file in one template, as
	suggested in:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/virt-tools-list/2012-June/msg00078.html

	In the implementation time, a limitation occurred, and I realized that
	I was doing the things in the wrong way. (if there is 1 script for all
	the files and _generate*() gives you 1 file as output, how we could
	generate different files from the unique file?) So, I would like to go
	back with the first implementation, creating different files for each
	file used by windows xp (e. g.)

	Add desktop profile for Fedora 15 and newer
	As talked on IRC, was decided to not install QXL drivers for older
	Fedora (16 or lesser). Why? We are keeping some hacks only to avoid
	broken QXL driver and, at least for now, we are removing these.

	install script: add config_param entity
	Now we need to set what are the configs that will be used in each
	script. To set it, just add, in the .xml's script file:
	<config>
	  <param name="..." policy="mandatory"|"optional"/>
	</config>

	For manage these configs, a new entity was created, called:
	OsinfoInstallConfigParam. And the OsinfoInstallScript entity is, now,
	keeping an internal list of the OsinfoInstallConfigParam entity.

	With these changes, applications that uses/will use libosinfo can check
	if an install script has some config to be set using, consulting by:
	- ConfigParam entity:
	osinfo_install_script_has_config_param(OsinfoInstallScript *script,
	                        const OsinfoInstallConfigParameter config_param);

	- Parameter name:
	osinfo_install_script_has_config_param_name(OsinfoInstallScript *script,
	                                            const gchar* name);

	install script: generates the output in a file
	Add variant of osinfo_install_script_generate() that outputs the
	script into a file in the given directory. Also add API to specify a
	custom prefix for generated file.

	Moreover, the "filename" attribute was added in the "template" element
	in the install script data, and it will be used as the output filename
	for each script and will be more detailed below. Also, support to this
	field was provided in the XML schema and in the osinfo_loader as well.

	About the osinfo-install-script tool:
	    If the prefix argument is NULL, the output files will be written as
	    set in data/install-scripts/*.xml (in filename attribute from
	    template element):
	        - Linuxes: fedora.ks
	        - Windows 2k3r2 and older: windows.sif
	        - Windows 2k8 and newer: windows.xml
	    Otherwise, the prefix will be prepended in the filename as:
	    <prefix>-<filename>

	    If the dirname argument is NULL, the output files will be written in
	    the current directory.

	It will be used to create, easily, multiple scripts, as used in:
	http://bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=214681

	Don't return a gboolean when a gchar * is expected

	Add "hostname" prop to install-script-config
	It is desirable to configure the hostname of the new virtual
	machine during initial automated provisioning

	Add win2k and win7 forgotten installers tag

	Expose forgotten APIs from install script config
	These APIs will be used, at least, by boxes

	Standardize function names
	Rename some functions' names to accord with the rest of API

	Fix function's name exposed by osinfo_db
	osinfo_db_get_install_script_list was being exposed with a wrong
	standard name (osinfo_db_get_install_scripts).

	Update README file
	Add dependencies needed by install scripts

2012-08-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update git ignore rules

	Add data files for Fedora & Windows unattended installs
	For Fedora this adds a kickstart file template which self-adapts
	to all Fedora versions 1-> 16

	For Windows this adds two file templates, one using the legacy
	SIF .ini file format for Win2k3 or earlier, and the other using
	the modern unattended XML format for Win2k8 or newer

	Add a command line tool for generating install scripts

	Add test suite for install script generation
	This test suite creates an OsinfoInstallConfig object and along
	with a demo XSL template, it generates some install scripts

	Associate install scripts with operating systems
	Operating systems now get a new element

	    <installer>
	      <script id='http://fedoraproject.org/scripts/fedora/jeos'/>
	    </installer>

	And there is a new top level element to go along with
	this:

	  <install-script id='http://fedoraproject.org/scripts/fedora/jeos'>
	    <profile>jeos</profile>
	    <template>
	      <xsl:stylesheet
	        xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	        version="1.0">
	       ....template for install script...
		</xsl:template>
	      </xsl:stylesheet>
	    </template>
	  </install-script>

	Add APIs for dealing with installer automation scripts
	This introduces two new objects

	 - OsinfoInstallConfig - stores configuration parameters which get
	   substituted into the install script template.
	 - OsinfoInstallScript - provides a template and the mechanism for
	   turning it into an install script using XSLT

	Add helper APIs to OsinfoEntity for boolean params

	Misc Fedora review fixes to Mingw RPM specfile

	API for getting product logo URLs
	While we will be able to neither ship any product logos nor provide URLs
	to them for legal reasons, this patch simply adds API for easily fetch
	URLs from *a* libosinfo database.

	Add Windows 7 Ultimate N identification
	This fixes https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676248
	Data provided by Vladimir Beneš <benesv@email.cz>

	build: allow building with newer glibc-headers and -O0
	Commit log and autoconf snippet written by Eric Blake for libvirt.

	glibc 2.15 (on Fedora 17) coupled with explicit disabling of
	optimization during development dies a painful death:

	In file included from /usr/include/limits.h:27:0,
	                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.7.0/include/limits.h:169,.
	                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.7.0/include/syslimits.h:7,
	                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.7.0/include/limits.h:34,
	                 from util/bitmap.c:26:
	/usr/include/features.h:314:4: error: #warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O) [-Werror=cpp]
	cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

	Work around this by only conditionally defining _FORTIFY_SOURCE,
	in the case where glibc can actually use it.  The trick is using
	AH_VERBATIM instead of AC_DEFINE.

	* m4/libosinfo-compile-warnings.m4 (LIBOSINFO_COMPILE_WARNINGS): Squelch
	_FORTIFY_SOURCE when needed to avoid glibc #warnings.

	Add a few more Win 7 volume IDs
	This commit adds test case data for the Windows 7 ISOs I have
	available locally and updates the windows 7 volume ID list
	so that make check still passes after these additions.

	Add more Windows XP test cases and a new volume ID
	Add the output of isoinfo -d -i image.iso for the Windows XP I
	have available locally, this makes make check a bit more extensive.
	Since make check was failing after these additions, this commit
	also adds the missing volume ID for Windows XP 64 bit with debugging
	enabled to windows.xml

	Add missing VX2PRMFPP Windows XP volume ID
	The commit adding lots of Windows XP signatures inadvertantly dropped one
	preexisting volume ID. This causes a make check failure

2012-06-08  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Stricter volume ID regex for Ubuntu server spins
	Without this fix, we end-up getting destkop media wrongly matched to
	server media.

2012-06-05  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Fix osinfo_list_add_union()
	This function was adding the second list elements to new list first so
	the order of elements in the new list was contrary to what user will
	expect of this function (and all wrapper/using functions).

2012-06-05  Wanlong Gao  <gaowanlong@cn.fujitsu.com>

	libosinfo: update the information of Fedora 17

2012-05-31  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Rework udev rule some more
	Now that the rules to remove device properties when the CD is ejected
	have been fixed, another bug in these rules shows up: there are 2 rules
	very similar to the rules for disk insertion. One of them matches
	ID_FS_TYPE != "iso9660" and the other matches ID_FS_TYPE != "udf" which
	means that at least one of them will trigger and will remove the
	OSINFO_* properties that have been just set by the insertion rules.

	While attempting to fix them, I've noticed that these properties go
	away anyway when the disk is removed and this has been confirmed on
	 #udev, so we can get rid of them.  While at it, I've added a test to
	check that the 'change' events correspond to a media change.

2012-05-23  Fabiano Fidêncio  <fabiano@fidencio.org>

	Import more Windows ISO signatures

2012-05-15  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Add missing % to %{rhel} macro
	This fixes the previous commit.

	Fix spec file for RHEL builds
	%fedora is not defined when building for RHEL, so we need to use
	%{?fedora} instead of %{fedora}. This commit also makes sure that
	newer RHELs will build libosinfo with introspection support.

2012-04-13  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix Ubuntu 10.04 detection
	LTS Ubuntu versions are respinned several times throughout their
	lifetime to integrate all the updates on the iso. When this
	happens, the volume ID becomes "Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS i386" for example.
	The additional 3rd digit is properly handled for 8.04 but not for
	10.04. This commit fixes the 10.04 volume ID regexp so that it handles
	this case, and also adds the missing "LTS" to the regexp (rhbz#811871).
	This fixes detection of the ubuntu 10.04.4 iso, I couldn't get my hands
	on an older 10.04 iso to double check this doesn't cause a regression.

2012-04-12  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	configure.ac: don't error out when vala autodetection fails
	When --enable-vala or --disable-vala are not passed to configure,
	configure.ac automatically checks for vala availability. However,
	in this case, it's erroring out when vapigen cannot be found instead
	of silently disabling it.

	configure.ac: set VAPIGEN when --enable-vala is passed
	It was only set when the vala detection was automatic (ie no
	--enable-vala on the command line)

2012-03-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix schema compliance bugs in OS data

	Expand RNG schema to cover latest additions
	 - Add 'distro' to RNG schema
	 - Allow 'short-id', 'upgrades' and 'derives-from' to occur
	   1 or more times

	Rename test data files to match changed distro short-id

2012-03-23  Fabiano Fidêncio  <fabiano@fidencio.org>

	Don't call memset() with zero length for padding

	Add missing initializers for OsinfoLabel structs

2012-03-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Disable vendor, distro & family display by default
	To make the output of osinfo-query more managable disable the
	display of vendor, distro & family fields. Only short-id,
	name, version & id are shown.

	Add 'distro' field to osinfo-query command
	Enable the osinfo-query command to display the contents of
	the 'distro' field

	Remove 'generic-linux' which are not an OS distro entries
	The 'generic-linux.xml'  file was only present because virt-install
	had some generic entries. Compatibility for virt-install does not
	need to be in libosinfo itself.

	Standardize format for OS id, short-id, distro, version
	Standardize the format used for creating 'id' and 'short-id' fields,
	based on distro, version & vendor website URL

	 - id:  http://{VENDORSITE}/{DISTRONAME}/{VERSION}
	 - short-id {DISTRONAME}{VERSION}

	eg,

	   distro=rhel
	   version=6.0
	   vendor=Red Hat

	Then

	   short-id=rhel6.0
	   id=http://redhat.com/rhel/6.0

	Also allow for a second short-id, which can be based on the
	codename {DISTRONAME}{CODENAME}, eg  short-id=ubuntuedgy

	The exception is windows where the {VERSION} number isn't
	really a distro version, but rather a kernel version.
	Use the common distro suffix in short-id / id instead
	ie, 2k, 2k3, vista, me, 95

	Add ancient Win16/NT operating systems
	For completness add in the 16-bit Windows OS and Win NT line
	of OS

	Rename 'vista' to 'winvista'
	All windows distros have a short name prefix of 'win'
	except for 'vista'. Fix that to be 'winvista'

	Add release/eol dates for windows

	Get rid of generic 'windows' template OS
	Make the OS database only contain real OS entries, no virtual
	ones like 'windows'. Create a diagram of the windows upgrade
	and derives paths, and apply this to the metadata correctly
	so we inherit in the same way the product code inherits

	Standardize OS family names as all lowercase
	The OS family names effectively refer to the kernel used.
	Switch them all to lowercase, and correct a few mistakes,

	  MacOS -> darwin
	  Windows -> win9x or winnt
	  Other -> msdos or netware

	    <family>darwin</family>
	    <family>freebsd</family>
	    <family>linux</family>
	    <family>msdos</family>
	    <family>netbsd</family>
	    <family>netware</family>
	    <family>openbsd</family>
	    <family>solaris</family>
	    <family>win9x</family>
	    <family>winnt</family>

	Fill in '<distro>' element for everything
	The following distro names are used, all in lowercase for
	compatibility with libguestfs

	    <distro>centos</distro>
	    <distro>debian</distro>
	    <distro>fedora</distro>
	    <distro>freebsd</distro>
	    <distro>mandrake</distro>
	    <distro>mandriva</distro>
	    <distro>mes</distro>
	    <distro>msdos</distro>
	    <distro>netbsd</distro>
	    <distro>netware</distro>
	    <distro>openbsd</distro>
	    <distro>opensolaris</distro>
	    <distro>opensuse</distro>
	    <distro>osx</distro>
	    <distro>rhel</distro>
	    <distro>rhl</distro>
	    <distro>sled</distro>
	    <distro>sles</distro>
	    <distro>solaris</distro>
	    <distro>ubuntu</distro>
	    <distro>windows</distro>

2012-03-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix handling of const path strings when loading files

	Handle short reads when extracting ISO headers
	You cannot assume that g_input_stream_read_async will return
	as many bytes as you requested. It is perfectly valid to get
	a short read. Code must be prepared to repeat the read operation
	multiple times until all data is read, or EOF/error occurs.

	Add support for loading extra local database files
	In addition to loading the system files from /usr/share/libosinfo/db,
	it will now also load files in /etc/libosinfo/db/ (if it exists) and
	$HOME/.local/config/libosinfo/db/ (if it exists)

	New APIs are also added to allow an application to load a subset
	of these locations, if they don't like the default behaviour

	Move database files into $datadir/db instead of $datadir/data

2012-03-15  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add osinfo-query man page to RPMs

2012-03-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove obsolete scripts for PCI/USB id conversion
	The osinfo-pciids-convert and osinfo-usbids-convert scripts
	are no longer required, since we can load the data files
	natively. Remove them to avoid a runtime dep on Perl.

	Fix whitespace at end of file

2012-03-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update entity test to cope with new 'id' parameter

	Move openbsd test data to take account of rename

	Add a 'osinfo-query' command line tool
	Enable end users to search the database with a new osinfo-query
	command. For example

	$ osinfo-query --fields=short-id,name os vendor="Fedora Project"
	 Short ID             | Name
	----------------------+------------------
	 fedora1              | Fedora Core 1
	 fedora2              | Fedora Core 2
	 fedora3              | Fedora Core 3
	 fedora4              | Fedora Core 4
	 fedora5              | Fedora Core 5
	 fedora6              | Fedora Core 6
	 ...

	Update git ignore rules

	Add a dummy "ID" property for entities
	When querying/processing entities, it is useful if the 'id' field
	appears just like other properties. Add a special case to handle
	this

	Fix XML loader to correctly distinguish vendor/product names & IDs
	The loading of pci.ids/usb.ids was setting the 'product' and
	'vendor' properties with ID values. The loading of devices from
	XML was setting 'product' and 'vendor' properties with name
	strings, but forgetting to parse ID values from the XML

	Flesh out FreeBSD & Mandriva distro data. Add NetBsd & Mandrake

	Add a 'distro' property for OS objects
	The OS 'family' property is used to refer to the kernel type of
	the OS. The new 'distro' property refers to the grouping of OS
	by a particular vendor. For example all Linux distros have a
	family of 'Linux', but their own distinct 'distro' value (Fedora,
	Ubuntu, etc). Debian is even more fun having alternate releases
	which use a Hurd of FreeBSD kernel, these variants will each have
	the 'hurd' or 'freebsd' family, with a common 'debian' distro.

2012-03-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix generation of docs in a VPATH builder
	The DOC_SOURCE_DIR variable was missing the $(top_srcdir) variable
	so it could not find the source files when run from a VPATH build.
	Empirically the previous comment saying that $(top_srcdir) was not
	needed is wrong.

	schema

	Fix numerous schema non-compliance bugs in the XML database

	Add an RNG schema for the libosinfo XML documents
	Create an RNG schema that will be installed into
	/usr/share/libosinfo/schemas/libosinfo.rng and can
	be used to validate XML files

	Import more Ubuntu distro ISO tests

2012-02-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove bogus treeinfo data for Fedora <= 6 & replace with initrd/kernel/bootiso

	Add test for tree URIs

	Add Fedora tree URLs

	Add support for install tree metadata
	The <media> element and OsinfoMedia class can be used to identify
	install media, ie ISO images.

	The <tree> element and OsinfoTree class are the same concept but
	used to identify installation trees.

	Add tests for Debian distro signatures

	Fix regex matching for OS media
	The current regex match rule is

	   If pattern is NULL and string is NULL
	      -> accept media
	   else if pattern is NULL or string is NULL
	      -> reject media
	   else
	      -> do regex compare

	The regex match rules ought to be

	   If pattern is NULL
	       -> accept media
	   Else if string is NULL
	       -> reject media
	   else
	       -> do regex compare

	The idea is that if the Osinfo database pattern is NULL, then
	regardless of whether the string is NULL or not, then we should
	allow that match. In effect a pattern == NULL, should be treated
	as equivalent to a regex ".*"

	Update git ignore files

2012-02-07  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Release 0.1.0

	Put symbols into their corresponding versions in syms file

	Match substring regex in the end
	Sometimes volume-id expression of one architecture is a substring of
	volume-id expression of another architecture for the same OS. For
	example '.*G.*RMC.*' is volume-id expression for i386 media of win7,
	while '.*G.*RMC.*X.*' is for x86_64. To avoid incorrect matching, we
	need to ensure that matching is done against '.*G.*RMC.*X.*' first and
	then '.*G.*RMC.*'.

2012-01-27  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Use ENV{} in udev rule
	There are only a handful of key names that can be directly assigned
	in an udev rule (through FOO=....), for device-specific properties,
	ENV{FOO} must be used.

2012-01-09  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Check PrimaryVolumeDescriptor size at compile-time
	Eric Blake suggested on the mailing list that we can use a dummy
	array declaration to trigger a compile error if the
	PrimaryVolumeDescriptor structure size isn't 2048 bytes.

2012-01-06  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Mark the volume descriptor structs as packed
	This tells gcc it shouldn't add some padding between the struct
	members. which is important because we rely on this structure size
	being exactly 2048. One of its members is guint8 ignored2[246]; (only
	a 2 byte multiple) so all the fields of the struct won't be aligned
	on a 8 byte boundary, so gcc could do some unexpected things on
	some arch.
	The 2 structs changed by this patch only use arrays whose elements have
	the same size as chars so gcc will probably don't try to change their
	alignment, but one never knows..

	Use g_str_has_suffix instead of opencoding it

2011-12-27  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Minor correction to win2k8 volume ID

2011-12-02  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Handle NULL GError **
	It's valid to pass NULL GError ** around when we are not interested
	in error reporting. This means we have to make sure the GError** is
	not NULL before dereferencing it. In particular, the right way of
	testing if GError **err; is set is to do if (err && *err) {}
	This commit adds a helper to do this check and uses it where needed.

	Fix OSINFO_MEDIA_ERROR_INSUFFIENT_METADATA typo
	This is an API change, but I don't think many application are
	checking error code values of libosinfo errors so I'd say we can
	do it a this point. A #define for the old symbolic name can be
	added if we don't want to break the API.

	Fix "insufficient metadata" test in on_pvd_read
	There are 2 issues with this test:
	1) it's not using is_str_empty, which means it won't do what's
	expected on some ISOs where "empty" descriptors are read as a
	string full of blank space
	2) it mandates the presence of a system or publisher descriptor in
	ISOs, which is not the case on ubuntu 11.10 ISOs. They only have a
	volume descriptor. Since on most ISOs, publisher is empty and
	system is "LINUX", they don't add much to discriminate between ISOs,
	so we don't really need to mandate the presence of one of these.

	Handle empty/NULL strings in is_str_empty

2011-11-30  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Remove useless prototype
	The static function it declares is defined immediatly after it.

	Remove unused python gobject import
	Nothing in examples/demo.py uses this import, and having it causes a
	runtime error:

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "examples/demo.py", line 4, in <module>
	    from gi.repository import Libosinfo as osinfo;
	  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/gi/__init__.py", line 23, in <module>
	    from ._gi import _API, Repository
	ImportError: could not import gobject (error was: ImportError('When using
	gi.repository you must not import static modules like "gobject". Please
	change all occurrences of "import gobject" to "from gi.repository import
	GObject".',))

	Make sure we don't set a GError twice in OSInfoLoader
	When parsing OSInfo XML documents, the catchXMLError callback may
	be called for non fatal errors. When this happens, we get a pointer
	to a parsed document which we can use, but we may have set a GError
	during the parsing if a non fatal error was logged. This means we
	have to make sure the error is cleared after the parsing, otherwise
	we may attempt to set it twice which is forbidden

	This can be triggered by running examples/demo.py:

	$ python examples/demo.py
	/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/types.py:43: Warning: GError set
	over the top of a previous GError or uninitialized memory.
	This indicates a bug in someone's code. You must ensure an error
	is NULL before it's set.
	The overwriting error message was: Incorrect root element

	Based on a patch from Mateusz Kaplon <mateusz.kaplon@gmail.com>.

2011-11-24  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix setting of property default value
	This commit reverts 4ba6a970dd4a6ba5e8efc49bb190c059f0d5b604.
	For the default value of a GObject to be set upon object construction,
	it needs to be marked as G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT or G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY.
	This commit adds this flag for the "installer" and "live" properties
	("installer" defaults to TRUE and we want this to be set when the
	object is created).

2011-11-24  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Correct flags for most Media properties
	Most properties are not supposed be construct-only.

	Initialize Media.installer to default value

	Don't entertain empty ID headers from ISOs

	Expose Media properties as gobject properties

	Detection tool should set env for media ID
	Detection tool now prints an environment variable 'OSINFO_MEDIA' with
	the value of the ID of the media in the OS that was positively matched
	against the media in question.

	This implies setting of a udev property for the device by the same name.

	Correct pattern matching logic
	If both pattern and string are NULL, they should match.

	API to indicate media is live and/or installer
	Add live and installer boolean getters to Media.

	Add live media data for Fedora 14-16

	Return matched OS media
	osinfo_db_guess_os_from_media() now has an out parameter that provides
	the caller a reference to returned OS's media that was matched against
	the passed media instance.

	WARNING: This commit breaks API but its not really an issue since we
	haven't yet promised API stability.

	Don't match non-live Fedora ISOs against live ones

2011-11-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update to newer COPYING.LIB file with correct FSF address

	Also include libosinfo.spec in tar.gz

	Remove contributors list from NEWS file
	This release is out but doing this so I don't forget the rule of not
	including contributors' list in next release announcement.

	Release 0.0.2

2011-11-21  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Add VolumeIDs for CentOS
	It doesn't seem to be possible to make the difference between a 32
	or 64 bit CentOS iso just by looking at its headers so the iso type
	guessing will need to be improved

	Fix CentOS 6.1 entry
	There were a few copy and paste typos

	Add VolumeIDs for 2011 Ubuntu releases
	Note that due to a bug in libosinfo, the detection of 11.10 won't work.
	The 11.10 isos don't have a system id nor a publisher id, so they end
	up as NULL in the parsed database, but they are a string of N consecutive
	space when read from the iso. This prevents the match from working.

	Fix <volume-id> for RHEL 5.x
	The VolumeID for RHEL 5.x was RHEL/5.x, it was changed to RHEL_6.x
	for RHEL6. I checked this with ISOs straight from RHN.

	Fix <volume-id> for RHEL 4.x
	The VolumeID for RHEL 4.x was RHEL/4-Ux, it was changed to RHEL_6.x
	for RHEL6. I checked this with ISOs straight from RHN.

	Fix <version> for RHEL 5.4
	There was a typo.

	Add openSUSE data

	Media ID strings are now regular expressions

	Fix 2 small mistakes in syms and docs

	Better udev rule installation
	Provide a configure option to set the udev rule directory. If this
	option is not set, udev directory defaults to '$prefix/lib/udev/rules.d'
	unless $prefix is '/usr' in which case it defaults to '/lib/udev/rules.d'.

2011-09-22  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Add udev rules file to RPM package

2011-09-19  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Make *.ids generation optional (failable)
	Just because one is hacking on git repo, doesn't mean he/she always have
	access to Internet so download of *.ids should not fail the entire
	build. They are not strictly needed anyways.

2011-09-15  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Don't worry on failure to install udev rule file
	This can easily fail (e.g if `make install` is run unprivileged) and its
	not a big deal if it does.

	Hard-code GIBIBYTES definition
	GIR scanner doesn't like it and its not like this value is going to
	ever change anyways.

	Load resources metadata from XML
	Implement loading of OS minimum and recommended resources from XML.

	Minor code clean-up

	Add Udev support
	If enabled, provide a udev rule to listen to insertion/removal of
	ISO9660 media and sets some helpful (to apps) properties on the device
	if media is bootable.

2011-09-01  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Add utility app that detects OS given a media
	Given a path to a ISO9660 image/device, detects if media is bootable and
	the relavent OS if media is an installer for it.

2011-08-23  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Async variant of osinfo_media_create_from_location()

	'new' -> 'create' in osinfo_media_new_from_location()
	Renaming osinfo_media_new_from_location() to
	osinfo_media_create_from_location() to emphasize the factory nature
	of this function.

	Also the convention in g* world is to keep _new() as only thin wrappers
	around g_object_new() calls.

	Replace OsinfoDb.guess_os_from_location() by guess_os_from_media()

	Add osinfo_media_new_from_location()
	Add API to create a OsinfoMedia object, given an installation media
	location. This includes moving of installation media errors to
	osinfo_media module and rename from OsinfoInstallMediaError to
	OsinfoMediaError.

	Some application/libraries will want to be able to get basic information
	about an installation media without having to load the whole metadata DB.

2011-08-22  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Add osinfo_db_guess_os_from_location()

2011-06-01  Zeeshan Ali  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Strip correct C namespace
	Fixes build against latest GIR.

2011-04-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add some scripts for converting USB/PCI ID lists to XML
	Add some scripts which are able to convert from the raw USB
	and PCI device ID lists to the osinfo XML format. Do not
	actually use these scripts by default though, because the
	osinfo loader can read the native formats *much* faster
	than reading the XML variant

	Pull down USB and PCI device IDs from sourceforge
	Populate the database with all USB and PCI device IDs known
	to the master sourceforge databases

	Load all files in data directory in example scripts
	* examples/demo.js, examples/demo.py: Load all files
	  from data/

	Allow the DB loader to process sf.net PCI/USB id lists
	Allow the DB loader to process the master lists of PCI and
	USB device IDs, as downloadable from sourceforge.

	Improve scalability of object list lookups
	Looking up a entity by ID is O(n) due to iteration over an
	array. This is impossibly slow with the full set of PCI
	and USB device IDs loaded. Add in a hashtable to provide
	for O(1) lookups

	Remove TAB characters (again)

	Allow arbitrary custom xml attributes with an x- prefix
	* data/libosinfo-dummy-data.xml: Some example custom attrs
	* osinfo/osinfo_entity.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.h: Add a
	  method for setting a parameter, rather than just adding
	  to it
	* osinfo/osinfo_loader.c: Allow custom xml attrs with
	  an 'x-' prefix
	* demo.js, demo.py: Update to demo new capabilities

	Add constants and API accessors for common parameters
	There are some standard parameters for products, devices and
	devicelinks. Add static constants and API accessors for these

2010-09-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add notes about possible data sources for populating the database
	Add notes about the possible sources for finding device info
	about operating systems and hypervisor platforms

	* docs/data-sources.txt: Note data sources for OS and hypervisors

	Remove some bogus symbols to fix Win32
	Win32 linker does not like linker scripts containing symbols
	which do not exist

	* osinfo/libosinfo.syms: Remove bogus symbols

	Introduce a OsinfoDeployment object
	The supported devices for deploying an OS on a platform are
	tracked as part of the main OS device list. This is not
	sufficiently flexible because it does not allow for tracking
	extra metadata against a (os, platform) pair. Introduce a
	new "deployment" object to track the metadata for deploying
	an OS on a platform.

	* docs/object-model.fig: Illustrate the object model
	* data/libosinfo-dummy-data.xml: Introduce deployment
	  metadata
	* examples/demo.py, examples/demo.js: Update for new
	  APIs
	* osinfo/Makefile.am, osinfo/libosinfo.syms,
	  osinfo/osinfo.h, osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_deployment.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_deploymentlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_deploymentlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_devicelink.c, osinfo/osinfo_loader.c: Introduce
	  an explicit deployment object
	* osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h, test/test-db.c,
	  test/test-os.c: Remove tracking of hypervisor preferred

2010-09-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix VPATH build for gtk-doc
	gtkdoc-scan is run from the source dir, so it the path must be
	relative to the source dir, not using $(top_srcdir) which is
	relative to the build dir.

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Fix docs path

	Add two examples using GObject introspection
	Add two example programs using GObject introspection bindings
	for Python (PyGObject) and Javascript (GJS)

	* examples/demo.js: Javascript demo
	* examples/demo.py: Python demo
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Add examples Makefile
	* examples/Makefile.am: Include demos in dist
	* libosinfo.spec.in: Include demo programs + docs
	* mingw32-libosinfo.spec.in: Kill docs

	Ensure args can be passed to autogen.sh
	Ensure that autogen.sh honours args passed to it, but passing
	them on down to gnome-autogen.sh, enabling usage such as

	   ./autogen.sh --enable-coverage

	* autogen.sh: Pass command line args down to gnome-autogen.sh

	Remove list iterator & add API to retrieve a GList
	The OsinfoList iterator method does not play nicely with
	gobject introspection bindings. Remove it, and replace with
	a method that returns a GList of elements. This trivially
	maps to the language bindings native list/array classes
	which are natively iterable.

	* docs/reference/Libosinfo-sections.txt: Remove osinfo_list_foreach
	  and add osinfo_list_get_elements
	* osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h: Remove osinfo_list_foreach

	Add API docs for all public methods
	Add GTK-DOC api docs for all public methods, signals, objects,
	enums, etc. Include annotations required for GObject Introspection
	to get reference counting / memory allocation correct when doing
	automatic language binding generation

	* osinfo/*.c: Add API docs for all methods / signals / objects / enums
	* osinfo/*.h: Ensure parameter names match those in the corresponding
	  .c file implementation to avoid confusing gtk-doc

	Remove 'self' as a parameter name.
	Using 'self' as a parameter name in methods makes the code feel
	more object-oriented, but it doesn't play nicely with gtk-doc
	because 'self' isn't a very descriptive name for docs. Replace
	all occurances of a 'self' with a short name for the object in
	question.

	* osinfo/*.c, osinfo/*.h: Remove use of 'self' as a parameter
	  name

	Integrate gtk-doc into the build for API docs
	* Makefile.am: Add docs subdir

	* osinfo/*.h, osinfo/*.c, tests/*c: Add footer setting emacs
	  indentation rules. Re-indent to comply.

	Avoid directly exposing internal lists in OsinfoDb
	Don't directly expose the OsinfoList objects used by the
	OsinfoDb class. Instead return a shallow copy of the lists.
	Add formal APIs for adding entities to the DB.

	* osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h: Add new
	  constructor to copy an existing list
	* osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h: Add API to
	  copy elements of an existing list
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h: Shallow copy
	  the lists before returning them. New APIs for adding
	  entities to the DB.
	* test/test-list.c, test/test-db.c: Update for changed APIs

2010-08-27  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ensure all GList return values are duplicated
	To avoid exposing callers to the internal implementation,
	ensure all returned GList * values are shallow-copied.
	All callers must g_list_free the value. The elements are
	not copied.

	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_filter.c, osinfo/osinfo_osfilter.c: Copy
	  all GList return values.

	for loading XML, introduce a new object that can
	handle XML loading. This then gives back a DB when
	loading is finished

	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h: Remove
	  backing-store property and xml loader methods
	* osinfo/osinfo_loader.c, osinfo/osinfo_loader.h: New class

	  test/test-db.c, test/test-loader.c: Update to
	  use new loader class

	Make OsinfoList typecheck the elements for compatibility
	To avoid have an OsinfoList with a mixture of hypervisor,
	os and device objects, associate an explicit type with
	each list. The list will validate the data type matches
	whenever adding elements to the list, or producing new
	lists via union/intersect/filter operations.

	* osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h: Add an
	  element-type property
	* osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c: Set the element-type when creating
	  a new list

	Lots of code fixes based on results from testsuite
	This fixes numerous memory leaks throughout the code
	identified by valgrind. It also fixes the const-ness
	of many parameters

	* osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c: Rewrite from scratch using DOM
	  APIs instead of streaming APIs
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_db.c: Remove 'libvirtVer' property

	* autogen.sh: Run configure

	Pull OS relationship filtering into a subclass
	The base filter object should only be concerned with
	filtering OsinfoEntity objects. Filtering OsinfoOs

	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.h: Convert
	  to use a GHashTable of GLists for properties

	  osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h: Replace
	  GTree with GList for OS relationships.

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove FREE_N

	Fix reference count handling in device list
	When adding an OsinfoEntity to an OsinfoList, an explicit
	reference should be taken on the entity, rather than
	relying on the caller to have done it.

	* osinfo/osinfo_list.c: Take an extra reference when
	  adding an entity to the list
	* osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c: Release a reference
	  after adding an entity to the list

	Turn filter matching functions into formal APIs
	Instead of having the osinfo_common.c module poking into
	the private parts of OsinfoFilter and OsinfoEntity
	objects, move the code into OsinfoEntity and use formal
	APIs for all data access

	* osinfo/osinfo_filter.c, osinfo/osinfo_filter.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.h: Add
	  API for matching entities against filters

	  all entity filtering code.
	* osinfo/osinfo_device.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.c: Update to
	  use formal entity filtering APIs

	Replace some temporary GTree objects with GHashTable
	Using a GHashTable + GList combination instead of GTree
	and GPtrArray results in shorter, simpler code and is
	more inline with normal GLib practice.

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h, osinfo/osinfo_db.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_list.c: Replace
	  several GTree objects with GHashTable

	Remove unused error strings
	Since most of the GError code was remove, the method
	__osinfoErrorToString is now unused, as are all the
	error strings. Remove them all

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.c, osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove
	  __osinfoErrorToString and all strings

	Make device object struct fully private
	Classes should not expose their private bits to each other. Make
	the OsinfoDevice private struct truely private.

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove OsinfoDevicePrivate
	* osinfo/osinfo_device.c: Add OsinfoDevicePrivate
	* osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c: Change 'int tmp' to 'gboolean unsed'

	Make osinfo DB struct private & change to use a OsinfoList internally
	Classes should expose their private bits to each other. Make
	the OsinfoDb private struct truely private. Switch from using
	a GTree in OsinfoDb over to a OsinfoList to simplify the code.

	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h: Add private data
	  struct & convert from OsinfoList instead of GTree
	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove OsinfoDbPrivate
	* osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h: Update
	  for API changes
	* osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h: Add API
	  for iterating over elements & finding an entity based
	  on its id.

	Add constructors for all objects. Remove constructor for abstract list object
	While using g_object_new() is functionally fine, it is not
	type-safe/checked. It should generally only be used by
	bindings for non-C language. Add explicit constructors for
	every object and update all callers of g_object_new to use
	the new constructors.

	* osinfo/osinfo.h, osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_device.c, osinfo/osinfo_device.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h: Add
	  constructors for all objects & use them

	Remove 'db' property from entity object to avoid circular reference
	The OsinfoDb object holds a reference to every OsinfoEntity.
	If the OsinfoEntity also holds a back-reference to OsinfoDb
	then no memory will ever be freed. The back-reference is
	not used in the code, so just remove it

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h, osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.c: Remove back-reference to the
	  OsinfoDb object from OsinfoEntity

	Remove GError from most APIs
	GLib documents that GError should only be used for recoverable
	runtime errors, not programmer errors. The latter should use
	g_return_val_if_fail / g_return_if_fail macros to display the
	programmer error

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.c, osinfo/osinfo_common.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_device.c, osinfo/osinfo_device.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_filter.c, osinfo/osinfo_filter.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h: Remove GError
	  from most public APIs

	Remove unused error variables from more iterators
	The iterators used in the OsinfoDb class pass around an GError
	object but none of the codepaths can ever fail, since all the
	ENOMEM code was remove. The GError variable is thus redundant

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h, osinfo/osinfo_db.c: Remove GError
	  from the iterators

	Remove many duplicate methods from device, hv & os list classes
	The OsinfoDeviceList,  OsinfoHypervisorList and OsinfoOsList
	classes don't need to provide accessors for list elements,
	since those are all available via the superclass OsinfoList.

	Re-work list intersection, union & filter APIs so that
	they add to the current list. Add constructors that
	allow creation of new lists with intersections, unions
	and filtering.

	* osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h: Remove all
	  list element accessors
	* osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h: Add constructors
	  for union, filter & intersection operations.

	Remove unused error variable from db populate list iterator
	The GError object passed around when getting lists of OS,
	or Hypervisor objects from the DB, is never actually set,
	nor can failure ever occur in any of the codepaths.
	Since it is unused, it can be removed completely.

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove errcode & err from
	  struct __osinfoPopulateListArgs.
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c: Don't pass around GError object
	  when populating entity lists

	Make osinfo_list_add into a public API
	Make osinfo_list_add a public API on OsinfoList since
	apps should be allowed to manipulate objects at will
	if they're not using the XML loader. This also avoids
	compile warnings from other objects using this API
	without it being declared

	* osinfo/osinfo_list.h, osinfo/osinfo_list.c: Make
	  osinfo_list_add a public API
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_filter.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.c: Update
	  for changing API name

	Remove all bad signed/unsigned casts in XML handling
	libxml2 strings are all 'unsigned char*' but C world normally
	uses 'char *', or 'gchar *' in GLib. Add appropriate casts
	and change variable types to avoid compiler warnings about
	implicit signed/unsigned casts.

	* osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c: Fix compile warnings about
	  signed/unsigned string casts

	Remove more malloc failure checks
	GLib will always abort() upon malloc failure, so there is
	no need to check return value of any g_object_new, g_new
	or g_strdup API call. Remove all this redundant ENOMEM
	checking

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.c, osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.c, osinfo/osinfo_filter.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c: Remove all ENOMEM checks

	Sanitize naming of filter object APIs
	The GObject naming conversion is lowercase, separated
	by underscores. This needs to be followed to allow
	gobject introspection to be auto-generated easily.

	* osinfo/osinfo_filter.c, osinfo/osinfo_filter.h: Convert
	  API naming to use lowercase + underscores. Add an
	  explicit constructor.

	Sanitize naming of all list object APIs
	The GObject naming conversion is lowercase, separated
	by underscores. This needs to be followed to allow
	gobject introspection to be auto-generated easily.

	* osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.c, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_list.c, osinfo/osinfo_list.h: Convert
	  API naming to use lowercase + underscores. Add
	  explicit constructors.
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_filter.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.c: Update
	  for changing API naming

	Santize naming of device, hypervisor and os object APIs
	The GObject naming conversion is lowercase, separated
	by underscores. This needs to be followed to allow
	gobject introspection to be auto-generated easily.

	* osinfo/osinfo_device.c, osinfo/osinfo_device.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h: Convert
	  API naming to use lowercase + underscores. Add
	  explicit constructors.

	Sanitize API naming for OsinfoEntity class
	The GObject naming conversion is lowercase, separated
	by underscores. This needs to be followed to allow
	gobject introspection to be auto-generated easily.

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove declaration of
	  methods that belong in osinfo_entity.h
	* osinfo/osinfo_entity.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.h: Convert
	  API naming to use lowercase + underscores. Add an
	  explicit constructor.
	* osinfo/osinfo_filter.c, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.c: Update
	  for changed API names

	Sanitize API naming for OsinfoDb class
	The GObject naming conversion is lowercase, separated
	by underscores. This needs to be followed to allow
	gobject introspection to be auto-generated easily.

	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Add -Wl,-no-undefined to ensure
	  any undefined symbols are caught
	* osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Remove declaration of
	  methods that belong in osinfo_db.h
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h: Convert
	  API naming to use lowercase + underscores. Add an
	  explicit constructor.
	* test/test-skeleton.c: Fix for changed API naming
	  and use OsinfoDb constructor

	Remove all redundant malloc failure checks
	GLib will always abort() upon malloc failure, so there is
	no need to check return value of any g_object_new, g_new
	or g_strdup API call. Remove all this redundant ENOMEM
	checking

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_device.c, osinfo/osinfo_entity.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_filter.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.c: Remove
	  all ENOMEM checking

	Add decl for all _get_type() methods & enable warnings
	Eliminate compile warnings about undeclared XXX_get_type()
	methods, by adding declarations for all objects.

	Switch to using standard GNOME m4 magic for compile
	warnings. Force enablement of automake maintainer
	mode, so that Makefile is re-generated if Makefile.am
	ever changes. Enable silent build rules so that compile
	warnings can be more easily spotted.

	* Makefile.am: Whitespace tweak
	* configure.ac: Remove -Wall, -Werror. Add
	  GNOME_COMPILE_WARNINGS, GNOME_MAINTAINER_MODE_DEFINES,
	  AM_MAINTAINER_MODE, AM_SILENT_RULES
	* osinfo/*.h: Add XXX_get_type() declarations for all
	  objects
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Add $(WARN_CFLAGS) to build

	Move Makefile.am into each sub-dir
	Move Makefile.am into each sub-dir so that built objects end
	up in the same directory as the sources, instead of polluting
	the top level. This will also enable the gobject introspection
	makefile rules to be imported later

	* .gitignore: test-skeleton & test-skeleton.sh
	* Makefile.am: Remove all build rules, add SUBDIRS
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Add build rules for library
	* test/Makefile.am: Add build rules for tests
	* test/test-skeleton.c: Update to reflect changed
	  current directory during test execution

	Move all source & headers into osinfo/ directory
	The GLib/GObject standard practice is to have all source and
	header files in the same directory, named after the library
	prefix. Move all headers from api/ and inc/ into src/, then
	rename src/ to osinfo/

	* src/*, api/*, inc/*: Move to osinfo/
	* Makefile.am: Update build rules for changed locations
	* configure.ac: change AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR
