The following variables are meaningful on the make command line:

EFI_ESP_ROOT	the directory where the EFI System Partition is mounted

The following rpm macros are set:

%efi			the arches that EFI packages should be built on, suitable for use with %ifarch
%efi_vendor		the vendor name for your EFI System Partition directory
%efi_esp_root		the directory where the EFI system Partition is mounted
%efi_esp_efi		the full path to \EFI on the EFI System Partition
%efi_esp_boot		the full path to \EFI\BOOT on the EFI System Partition
%efi_esp_dir		the full path to your vendor directory on the EFI System Partition
%efi_arch		the EFI architecture name, e.g. x64
%efi_arch_upper		the EFI architecture name in upper case, e.g. X64
%efi_alt_arch		the EFI architecture name for other arches that build on this one (i.e. ia32 on x64)
%efi_alt_arch_upper	the upper case version of %efi_alt_arch
