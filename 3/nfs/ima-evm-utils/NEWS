2020-07-21  Mimi Zohar <zohar@linux.ibm.com>

	version 1.3 new features:
	* NEW ima-evm-utils regression test infrastructure with two initial
	  tests:
	  - ima_hash.test: calculate/verify different crypto hash algorithms
	  - sign_verify.test: EVM and IMA sign/verify signature tests
	* TPM 2.0 support
	  - Calculate the new per TPM 2.0 bank template data digest
	  - Support original padding the SHA1 template data digest
	  - Compare ALL the re-calculated TPM 2.0 bank PCRs against the
	    TPM 2.0 bank PCR values
	  - Calculate the per TPM bank "boot_aggregate" values, including
	    PCRs 8 & 9 in calculation
	  - Support reading the per TPM 2.0 Bank PCRs using Intel's TSS
	  - boot_aggregate.test: compare the calculated "boot_aggregate"
	    values with the "boot_aggregate" value included in the IMA
	    measurement.
	* TPM 1.2 support
	  - Additionally support reading the TPM 1.2 PCRs from a supplied file
	    ("--pcrs" option)
	* Based on original IMA LTP and standalone version support
	  - Calculate the TPM 1.2 "boot_aggregate" based on the exported
	    TPM 1.2 BIOS event log.
	  - In addition to verifying the IMA measurement list against the
	    the TPM PCRs, verify the IMA template data digest against the
	    template data.  (Based on LTP "--verify" option.)
	  - Ignore file measurement violations while verifying the IMA
	    measurment list. (Based on LTP "--validate" option.)
	  - Verify the file data signature included in the measurement list
	    based on the file hash also included in the measurement list
	    (--verify-sig)
	  - Support original "ima" template (mixed templates not supported)
	* Support "sm3" crypto name

	Bug fixes and code cleanup:
	* Don't exit with -1 on failure, exit with 125
	* On signature verification failure, include pathname.
	* Provide minimal hash_info.h file in case one doesn't exist, needed
	  by the ima-evm-utils regression tests.
	* On systems with TPM 1.2, skip "boot_aggregate.test" using sample logs
	* Fix hash_algo type comparison mismatch
	* Simplify/clean up code
	* Address compiler complaints and failures
	* Fix memory allocations and leaks
	* Sanity check provided input files are regular files
	* Revert making "tsspcrread" a compile build time decision.
	* Limit additional messages based on log level (-v)
