keybinder-3.0 v0.3.2
--------------------

* Fix ``keybinder_bind`` and others to not crash on non-X11 displays.
  It simply returns FALSE, failing to bind the key.
* Add new API:

  ``gboolean keybinder_supported()``
    Return TRUE if on key bindings are implemented for this
    configuration. (Right now: only TRUE if gtk says there's an X11
    display)

* Fix deprecated directives in build system

keybinder and keybinder-3.0  v0.3.0
-----------------------------------

Released Sunday, 17 June 2012

* Patch Makefile.am to use ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS=-I m4 (by Luca Falavigna)
* Add two functions to fix gobject-introspection (gir) bindings:

  ``keybinder_bind_full(keystring, callback, user_data, notify)``
      Uses GDestroyNotify for notification of callback
      unregistration. This function is compatible with introspected
      bindings unlike ``keybinder_bind``.
      Exported as ``keybinder_bind`` (``bind``) to bindings.

  ``keybinder_unbind_all(keystring)``
      unregister all callbacks for the specified keystring.
      ``keybinder_unbind``'s signature cannot be supported by
      introspection bindings, and unbinding all matches the common use
      case (especially from bindings).
      Exported as ``keybinder_unbind`` (``unbind``) to bindings.

* Build a gobject-introspection ``.typelib`` file for libkeybinder
* Add a reference manual for libkeybinder using gtk-doc
* Branch the library into two simultaneously installable libraries

  + ``keybinder`` is like the old version, using Gtk+ 2, package name
    ``keybinder`` (pkgconfig) and ``Keybinder-0.0`` (gir)
  + ``keybinder-3.0`` is a new version, using Gtk+ 3, package name
    ``keybinder-3.0`` (pkgconfig) and ``Keybinder-3.0`` (gir)

  + ``keybinder-3.0`` removes ``python-keybinder`` because pygtk will
    never be compatible with Gtk+ 3. Instead gir bindings have to be
    used.

  + These libraries will possibly have separate releases in the future
    but their first release is simultaneous, it is now.

  + ``keybinder-3.0`` is distributed under X11 license, since the GPL
    parts have been removed (python-keybinder and ax_lua).
    The old branch ``keybinder`` is still GPL!
 

keybinder v0.2.2
----------------

Released Sunday, 20 May 2010

* Add pkg-config file contributed by Jérôme Guelfucci
* Add Vala example and .vapi file to examples/
* Make lua-keybinder installable (this is experimental), using ax_lua.m4

keybinder v0.2.1
----------------

Released Monday, 26 April 2010

* Release key grabs if binding fails partially.

keybinder v0.2.0
----------------

Released Saturday, 24 April 2010

* Split into libkeybinder library and python-keybinder so that the same
  module can be used from Python or C. The Python bindings are now optional.

* Add examples/ directory with C, Python and Lua examples (including
  experimental Lua bindings).

keybinder v0.1.1
----------------

Released Wednesday, 21 April 2010

* Workaround GTK+ Bug 616401
  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616401

* Don't bind anything when mapping virtual modifiers fail
  (Kupfer bug :lp:`566945`)

keybinder v0.1.0
----------------

Released Tuesday,  6 April 2010

* Depend on GTK+ 2.20

* Remove egg* code


keybinder v0.0.9
----------------

Released Tuesday,  6 April 2010

* Replace some egg* code with GTK+ functionality.

* Take great pains to understand "Consumed Modifiers", as in:

  + When pressing *Ctrl+Shift+1* to make *Ctrl+!*, Shift is a consumed
    modifier. So when receiving a binding specification like
    ``<Ctrl>exclam``, we have to dig deep into XKB to find out which
    hardware modifiers are needed to create the bang (!) character.
    With this, it is now possible to bind any composed character.


* Keybindings now work in alternative layouts as well, you just have to
  press the same hardware keys as in the primary layout.  For example a
  keybinding *Ctrl+W*  will still be available on the same physical
  keys after switching to a secondary Greek layout.

* Remove keybinder.is_modifier from the module

* Use -Wall


keybinder v0.0.4
----------------

Released 22 November 2009

* Remove bogus dependencies from configure checks (gnome-doc-utils and
  gnomeapplet)
* Enable ``AM_SILENT_RULES``
* Fix language errors in documentation
