Release history for libmodulemd

2.13.0      2021-07-09

This release is fully compatible with the previous 2.12.1 version.

Enhancements:
- Add /data/demodularized/rpms list to modulemd and modulemd-packager formats.
  The listed binary RPM package names will be handled by a package manager as
  removed from all previous module versions. This enables moving a package from
  a module to a non-modular package set.
- modulemd-validator tool enables you to constrain a document type with a new
  "--type" option. Without this option, all document types recognized by
  a modulemd index are accepted. To validate version 3 of modulemd-packager
  format, use "modulemd-validator --type modulemd-packager-v3 foo.yaml"
  command.
- Allow disabling Python 3. You can pass -Dwith_py3=false to a meson setup
  command to disable building a binding for Python 3. The binding is enabled
  by default.

Fixes:
- Reject invalid integers. Purely non-numeric values and negative numbers where
  an unsigned type is mandated by a specification raise a parser error now.
- Handle a failed g_setenv() call in modulemd-validator.
- Prevent from dereferencing a NULL pointer when reporting invalid
  subdocuments.
- A build script now refuses to disable Glib introspection
  (-Dskip_introspection=true) while a Python binding is requested
  (-Dwith_py3=true).
- "modulemd-validator --version" command returns 0 exit code now.


2.12.1      2021-05-03

This is a bug-fix release fully compatible with the previous 2.12.0
version. Notable changes:

Enhancements:
- Improve diagnostic messages for compression tests.
- Tests performed in a GitHub continues integration are faster.
- Use GitHub actions to perform CI tests also on ArchLinux, Mageia,
  Mandriva, and OpenSUSE.

Fixes:
- Relax context value up to 13 characters including an underscore
  character in modulemd v2 format. This reenables scratch-builds in MBS.
- Migrate Packit tests from a deprecated current_version_command to
  a newer actions/get-current-version.


2.12.0      2021-01-15

Enhancements:
- Enable component 'buildorder' for modulemd-packager v2 and v3 documents.

Fixes:
- When adding obsoletes ensure index has stream mdversion at least 2.
- Add missing @staticmethod for python2.
